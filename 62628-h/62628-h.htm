<p>This is a book about Persia, intended
to be read by children; and, on this account, much
has had to be left out. Do not think, when you have
read this book, that you know how bad Muhammadanism
is, for a great deal of its sin and cruelty is too
terrible to tell to young folks. But I hope enough
has been said to show you that Persian children do
need to be rescued from Muhammadanism and brought
to the Lord Jesus Christ to be His children. He
needs them and they need Him. So for His sake and
theirs we must do all we can to win the Persians for
Christ.</p>

<p class="ph1">CHILDREN OF PERSIA</p>



<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>MUHAMMAD</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> we look at the Persian children of to-day,
let us go back nearly thirteen and a half centuries to
the year of our Lord 570, and take a look at two
adjoining countries in Europe and two adjoining
countries in Asia.</p>

<p>In Western Scotland, St Columb is teaching the
people Christianity, and is writing out copy after copy
of the Bible, until tradition tells that he copied it out
three hundred times.</p>

<p>In England the heathen Saxons are conquering the
Midlands and crushing out the Christianity of the
Britons.</p>

<p>In Persia there is a Christian Church, but most of
the people are Zoroastrians, that is, they belong
to the Parsee religion. They worship God and believe
in a prophet called Zoroaster, who lived long before
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so knew
nothing about Him. He seems to have taught his
people much that was very good, but their religion has
become full of superstitions.</p>

<p>Lastly, we must go to Arabia, where a Muhammadan
legend describes a curious scene.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>A number of Arab women are riding into the town
of Mecca. Their animals are weary and very thin and
weak, for it is a year of famine. Last of all comes a
woman with a crying baby, riding on the thinnest and
most miserable looking donkey of all the company.
They are nurses from the healthiest part of Arabia,
come to find children to take home and nurse, each
hoping to get the child of a wealthy man, who will
pay her well, and give her handsome presents.</p>

<p>They are not long kept waiting. The babies are
brought out, and questioning and bargaining begin.
One baby is not popular&mdash;the whisper goes round that
it is an orphan&mdash;there is no father to give presents&mdash;the
grandfather who is looking for a nurse will surely
not do much for it. And so one after another all the
women refuse the baby, and the old man begins to
despair of success. All the women have found
nurslings except one, the woman who rode in last.
She, too, has refused the orphan, but now, seeing no
hope of a better bargain, rather than have taken her
journey for nothing, she tells the old man she has
changed her mind, and carries the baby home. And
the story runs that the thin weak donkey that could
hardly drag itself along as it entered Mecca, ran along
so nimbly on the way home that the rest could
scarcely keep up with it.</p>

<p>The orphan baby was Muhammad, the founder
of the religion called after him Muhammadanism.
Some of the details of this story (told by a Muhammadan
writer) are probably quite untrue. Little
Muhammad&#8217;s grandfather was known to be very rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and in a very high position, and if the baby was refused
it was probably because he was a sickly child,
and would be difficult to rear. However, in due course
he grew bigger, and came home to his mother, and after
her death lived with his old grandfather, who thought
all the world of him.</p>

<p>Mecca was an interesting town to live in, for once
a year pilgrims from all parts of Arabia came to the
great idol temple, and little Muhammad would see all
there was to be seen, for his grandfather kept the keys
and superintended everything.</p>

<p>When his grandfather died he went to live with his
uncle, who used to take him on business journeys, going
through the wide deserts to distant towns with long
strings of camels loaded with goods to sell. So the
boy grew up a good man of business and saw much of
foreign countries and something of foreign religions,
Christianity, Judaism, and Parsiism, and he grew discontented
with his own country and his own religion.</p>

<p>All the great peoples round worshipped one God.
Surely Arabia would be a better and greater country if
it did the same. All the great religions had a prophet
and a book. The Christians had Jesus Christ and the
Gospel, the Jews had Moses and the Law, even the
Parsees had Zoroaster and his book the Zend Avesta.
Surely what the Arabs needed was a prophet and a book.</p>

<p>Muhammad was not the only person who thought
this. There was a group of people, several of whom
were relations of him or of his wife, who shared this
view. Some of them thought that Moses and the Law
would be best for Arabia; but many of them saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Jesus Christ and the Gospel were what they needed,
and most of these in the end became Christians. If
Muhammad had joined them, the history of the world
from then to now might have been very different.
But Muhammad had set his heart on an Arabian
prophet and an Arabian book, and the more he
thought of it the more sure he felt that this was the
real way to unity and greatness for Arabia.</p>

<p>He himself belonged to the family which took the
lead in religious matters in Arabia, he had always
been made much of, and told he would be a great man;
he used to have fits which seemed to him and to
others to mark him out as something out of the
common; so it is not surprising that he at last came
to believe that he was to be the new Arabian prophet
who seemed to him to be so badly wanted. His fits began
to take the form of visions, and he believed that the
words of the longed for book were being revealed to him.</p>

<p>But it was a long time before he came forward
publicly, and when he did he was a good deal laughed
at, and only a few became his followers. Then he got
an invitation to the town of Medina, where he had a
number of cousins. The people of Medina were very
jealous of Mecca, and all, whether they believed in him
or not, joined in giving Muhammad a great welcome.</p>

<p>It was in Medina that Muhammad really founded
his religion, and there he became a very great
man. But sad to say, as his religion developed all its
bad points came out, and Muhammad became a very
cruel tyrant and very self-indulgent, excusing himself
by saying that God allowed him, because he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
prophet, to do things which were sinful when other
people did them.</p>

<p>The people who joined Muhammad&#8217;s religion were
called Muhammadans or Muslims, and they went everywhere
making as many converts as they could, by fair
means or foul. They had learnt that there was one
God, but they knew nothing of the Bible; they only
knew the Quran, the book which Muhammad was
revealing, and they knew nothing of the example of
Jesus Christ: their only example was Muhammad,
who was a murderer.</p>

<p>You may wonder what all this has to do with
Persian children. One of the first countries conquered
by the Muhammadans was Persia&mdash;and the Persian
children to-day are themselves Muhammadans.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>PERSIA</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a story that when the Muhammadans took
Persia and killed the Parsee king Yazdigird, their
<i>Khalif</i> &#8216;Omar asked Yazdigird&#8217;s son where he would
like to live. He said he would like to settle in Persia
out of reach of any cultivated spot. &#8216;Omar accordingly
sent him off with an escort of soldiers to find a suitable
place. After three years he returned and said he
could not find any place such as he had asked for.
&#8216;Omar saw that he was doing all this with some purpose,
and asked him what it was. Yazdigird&#8217;s son
answered that he wanted to show &#8216;Omar how prosperous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and well cultivated the land had become in the hands
of the Parsees, and begged him to see to it that it
remained so under the Muhammadans.</p>

<p>But it did not, and to-day a great deal of Persia
has relapsed into desert.</p>

<p>In our country all is green, and stones have to be
put up to show where one village ends and the next
begins. In most parts of Persia you may look over
the plain and see the villages quite distinct&mdash;each a
little green blot on a vast sheet of sand or dry earth.</p>

<p>The very fruitfulness of the ground makes it less
green than it would otherwise have to be to support the
population, for when three crops can be got off the
same piece of land in one year, only a third of the
amount of land that you would expect to be needed to
support the village is under cultivation.</p>

<p>The villages vary very much. Some count their
population by hundreds, while one village, marked on
the map, contains just two families, seven persons in
all, including two children. Their nearest neighbours
live six miles off, over the sand.</p>

<p>How bare the world must appear to those two
little children. Children here who live in the
country can hardly imagine any boundary to the
wonderful green tangle that they can see on every
side of them. And children who live in towns look
out every day upon wonderful human works, which,
although they are not as marvellous as God&#8217;s country,
yet puzzle them very much as to how they were ever
made. With a Persian child it is quite different. In
many places the children do not know what wild growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
is, and if you talk of continuous country, hundred miles
after hundred miles of field and wood and meadow,
they think you are telling an impossible fairy tale.
While as for the little town children, the buildings
which they see all round them made of sun-dried bricks
and earth, the barrels and the thousand and one
household utensils formed of exactly the same material,
or perhaps of clay very roughly baked in a primitive
kiln, seem to them hardly more artificial and man-made
than the corn in the walled gardens outside the city,
which they see watered twice a week.</p>

<p>They have a very different life from you and me.</p>

<p>Little Ahmad was a sturdy, jolly little lad of four
when I knew him, and, though he ought to have known
better, he used to call after me (if his parents were out
of hearing) the rhyme so familiar to Europeans in
Persia&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Ferangi,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Chi rang-i,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Palang-i,</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>which, translated into English, means&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">European,</div>
<div class="verse">What colour art thou?</div>
<div class="verse">Thou art a leopard.</div>
</div></div>

<p>He lived in a really beautiful house, built of sun-dried
bricks and clay, and whitened inside with a smooth
coat of plaster of Paris.</p>

<p>The rooms were large and very nicely furnished with
beautiful Persian carpets, and a mattress and pillows
of gay designs, and Ahmad, little rascal though he was,
would never have dreamed of treading on those carpets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with his shoes on; all shoes were left at the door.
One small table for the tea-urn completed the furniture.
And upstairs? Upstairs was the roof, such a lovely
large flat roof, Ahmad loved it, and he often terrified
his mother by the way he leaned over the low wall to
look down at the street, for the house had no window
looking to the road. All the windows looked into the
garden, which might be said to be in the middle of the
house, for the rooms were built round it. The windows,
too, were all doors; some of the rooms had as many as
five double doors all in a row, and when they were all
open the room was very airy and bright.</p>

<p>There was no grass, and no gravel path for Ahmad to
play on, but there was a nice wide brick-paved walk all
round the garden, which gave him plenty of room. In
the centre were the beds, which were watered by turning
a stream in and flooding them once a week. There were
watering cans, but they were only used for watering the
path and roof, and even the rooms, to keep them cool, not
for the flower beds. There was a large tank, too, in the
garden with gold fish in it, where Ahmad loved to cool
his feet on a hot day, and the days can be hot in Persia.</p>

<p>When it was dinner-time in Ahmad&#8217;s home a cloth
was spread on the floor, and he sat on his heels beside
it, and had a loaf of bread for a plate. It was flat and
round, and about as thick as a plate, so it did very well.
But he had no spoon or fork.</p>

<p>One of the things he liked best was rice, and when
his mother put a few handfuls on his bread he would
eat it quickly and tidily with one hand, without spilling
any, which is not as easy as it sounds.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Sometimes Ahmad went out for a walk in the town
with his father, or with his mother and a servant, and
he passed along streets that had not any names, and
by houses that had not any names or numbers. There
was no pavement except sometimes a narrow strip in the
middle of the road for the mules and donkeys. There
were no gardens in front of the houses, there were no
windows facing the road, all he saw was a sandy road
with a high mud wall on each side, and a heavy wooden
door here and there, the front door of a house.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A STREET OF SHOPS</p>

<p>Sometimes they came to a &#8220;<i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i>&#8221; or street of
shops. Here the street was covered over with a
mud roof so that goods and sellers and purchasers
might keep cool in hot weather and dry in wet weather.
He did not need to go into the shops, for the counters
were all along the street and there were no windows.</p>

<p>When the summer was getting very hot, it was
decided that Ahmad and all his family should go for a
summer holiday to a village in the hills.</p>

<p>What a packing up there was! They packed the
carpets, they packed the beds, they packed the kettles
and saucepans. Then a number of mules were brought
to the door and such a shouting and bustle began as
the loads were roped together, two and two, and slung
across the big padded pack-saddles. One mule carried
two great covered panniers and these were filled with
cushions, and Ahmad&#8217;s great-grandmother got into
one, and his mother got into the other to balance her,
and they pulled the curtains well over the front, so
that no one might see them. Ahmad himself sat in
front of a servant who held him safe, and some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
bedding made a nice broad soft seat for them on the
mule&#8217;s back. At last all the mules were ready with
their loads and off they set through the streets, and
soon they found themselves outside the town, going
mile after mile across the bare desert plain. This
went on for fifteen miles and then they reached a large
village at the foot of the hills. They had been riding
five hours and were tired and hungry, so they dismounted
at the <i>caravansarai</i> or inn. One of the
servants took a carpet off one of the loads and got a
cloth and some food wrapped up in a large handkerchief
out of the saddlebags and spread a meal on the
ground, while another got the tea-urn and charcoal,
boiled the water and made the tea. After a few hours&#8217;
rest on the roof, the shouting and loading began again
and off they went, up the hill, which was terribly steep
in some places. Now they saw scattered and stunted
plants growing here and there, and finally, after
another seven hours, they reached their summer
holiday quarters in a little hill village.</p>

<p>How Ahmad enjoyed the hills and fields and trees,
the flowers and birds and butterflies. A little brook
ran down the valley and on either side were cornfields
and orchards and gardens, as many as the brook could
provide water for. And at night Ahmad would hear
the shouting, as &#8216;Ali Muhammad declared that Husain
had had his fair share of water and now it was his turn
to have it for his orchard. For water is very precious
in Persia, and must be made the greatest possible use
of, day and night alike.</p>

<p>But the little children who live in the village are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
not so fortunate as little Ahmad. They work all the
summer at gardening, shepherding, and other work;
but in winter they have to stay in, and they live upstairs
and their sheep and goats downstairs. But
the stairs are outside and sometimes it is too cold for
them even to go down to feed the animals. If they
can they make a little fire of sticks in the oven, which
is only a deep, round hole in the floor, and when the
flame has died down they sit round with their legs
hanging into the oven and cover over the opening to
keep it warm as long as possible. One very severe
winter there was a report current in the town that in
this village the water was all frozen and that the animals
were dying because there was not enough fuel to melt
the ice and give them water. The poor children must
have had a very hard time that winter.</p>

<p>Even in the town Ahmad is one of the fortunate
children. Little Soghra had a very different home. She
lived with her grandmother in a single small room.
The floor was mud, covered in one place by a
small ragged piece of coarse matting. On this the
grandmother lay, for she was old and ill. The bedclothes
were filthy and torn. One side of the room
was filled with a pile of pomegranate skins, which are
used for making dye, and there were several fowls
wandering about. There was no furniture, nothing
but a few old pots and cups and a waterbottle. And
yet Soghra was a cheery little girl, and she and her
grandmother were very fond of each other.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>PERSIAN BABIES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">A Persian</span> baby&mdash;what a funny little mortal! It
looks for all the world like a little mummy, rolled up in
handkerchiefs and shawls till only its little face peeps
out, and tied up with a long strip of braid exactly like
a parcel tied up with string. Hasn&#8217;t it got any arms
and legs? Oh, yes, safely put away inside all those
wrappings and put away carefully too&mdash;straightened
out and rolled up so thoroughly that it will stand up
stiff and straight against the wall though it is only a
week old.</p>

<p>How surprised and shocked the Persian mothers are
to see the English babies kicking and throwing their
arms about. &#8220;O Khanum, aren&#8217;t you afraid its limbs
will grow crooked? Why don&#8217;t you bind them
straight? Aren&#8217;t you afraid its legs will get broken
if you leave them loose like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>So at its very start on life&#8217;s journey the poor little
Persian baby is checked and prevented from growing
up properly; for how can its little legs grow strong
without kicking? It is no wonder that Persian babies
as a rule learn to walk much later than English babies.</p>

<p>But perhaps the Persians are not quite so foolish
as they seem when they roll their babies up in these
stiff little bundles. Very likely the little arms and
legs <i>would</i> be broken or bent if they were left loose,
for many of the Persian mothers are very young&mdash;much
too young to know how to look after babies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
They often treat them like dolls and would very
likely break them just as English girls break their
dolls.</p>

<p>Even the grown-up mothers are often very careless.
One woman I knew laid her baby, not quite a year old,
on a chair, and left it there. Of course it fell off&mdash;it
was sure to; and yet she did this over and over again,
and a few days later dropped it into a stream of water.
She was very much surprised that it began to have fits
at this time, and she said she could think of nothing
to account for them.</p>

<p>A new missionary, who did not know the ways of
Persians, went one day to see another woman and found
her in bed, that is, lying on a mattress on the floor
under a large quilt. Her friends invited the missionary
to sit on the quilt beside her, for they do not use
chairs in most Persian houses. After she had sat for
some time she enquired for the baby. They pointed
to a little lump in the quilt, and there, close beside
her, entirely covered up and invisible, was the baby,
and it gave the poor missionary a terrible shock
to see how near she had been to sitting down upon
it. After that, she always asked to see the baby before
she sat down.</p>

<p>A baby less than a week old was brought one day
to the Julfa hospital with its face badly torn by a cat.
A few days later the doctor went into the ward and
found the mother smoking and gossiping with the other
women, but the baby was nowhere to be seen. &#8220;Where
is the baby?&#8221; &#8220;It is all right,&#8221; said the mother;
&#8220;I put it <i>under the bed</i>.&#8221; And sure enough, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
way off, under a bed (this time an English bed) lay the
poor little bundle, its arms bound to its sides, only
its little face exposed, or rather half-exposed, for the
torn half was covered with a dressing, while close at
hand there prowled in search of food a large half-wild
cat, which frequented the hospital and had slipped in
at an open door.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>When they get a little older the babies are laid in
broad comfortable leather hammocks slung between
rings let into the walls of the room. Most Persian
rooms have these rings in the walls. These hammocks
save the Persian mothers a great deal of trouble, for a
single push will set the hammock swinging for a long
time and keep the baby quiet or send it to sleep.</p>

<p>No baby may be left alone in a room till it is forty
days old.</p>

<p>From the very first the baby is given <i>kaif</i> every-day,
that is, something to make it sleep; this <i>kaif</i>
is almost invariably opium. After the first week
most babies are also given tea every day, without milk
but with a great deal of sugar in it, or better still
sugar-candy. This is considered specially good for
babies, but it takes a long time to dissolve. Both
opium and tea are very bad for the baby&#8217;s digestion,
so we are not surprised to find that nearly all Persians
suffer from indigestion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A BABY IN HAMMOCK</p>

<p>There is one Persian custom connected with babies
that boys and girls of other lands would probably like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to introduce into their own country. The newly-arrived
baby is weighed and its weight in sweets is
handed round to the people in the house, and it is
supposed to bring bad luck to the baby if anyone
refuses its sweets. Plenty of people always drop in
when they hear that a new baby has arrived.</p>

<p>Another Persian rule for babies would not please
your mothers at all. After the first bath no baby
must be washed all over till it is a year old. One
Persian lady, who was better educated than most,
and had been reading about European ideas on health
and cleanliness, told the missionaries that she was
bringing up her little boy just like a European baby.
She said she gave him a bath every day and generally
let him kick instead of tying his legs up to make them
straight. She was delighted and triumphant when,
instead of getting crooked, his legs grew so strong that
he walked at about half the usual age. But when he
was nearly a year old his body became covered with
sores and the missionary doctor told the mother to
wash them not with ordinary water in the bath, but
with a lotion. &#8220;I should never think of washing them
in the bath,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His body must not be washed
till he is a year old.&#8221; &#8220;But I thought,&#8221; said the doctor,
&#8220;that you gave him a bath every day.&#8221; &#8220;Oh dear
no,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;I don&#8217;t wash his <i>body</i>. It is his <i>legs</i>
that I wash every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>When a Persian baby learns to talk it begins just
like any other baby, so that the Persians declared
with great glee that the English babies were talking
Persian when they said &#8220;Baba&#8221; and &#8220;Dada.&#8221; But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
instead of &#8220;Daddy&#8221; and &#8220;Mummy&#8221; Persian babies
call their father and mother <i>B&#257;b&#257;</i> and <i>Nana</i>.</p>

<p>When the baby is shown to anyone the mother
generally remarks that it is an ugly little thing, and
similarly the visitors are expected to say how ugly and
dark it is, though there is no need to say it with any
great conviction. It is possible to say &#8220;How ugly you
are&#8221; just as affectionately as &#8220;You little darling.&#8221;
But such uncomplimentary remarks are used to avert
bad luck and to guard against any suspicion of the evil
eye. If the visitor makes any complimentary remark
she must add &#8220;<i>M&#257;sh&#257;&#8217; all&#257;h</i>&#8221; (<i>i.e.</i>&#8220;May God avert it&#8221;),
or the parents will be seriously alarmed, and Baby&#8217;s
admirer may be held responsible for any calamity
which befalls him for weeks afterwards.</p>

<p>Bibi Fati was the mother of four dear little children,
Rubabeh, Hasan, Riza, and Sakineh, and very dearly
she loved them. One day they were all gathered together
for dinner when in walked a poor old beggar
woman in search of a meal. She was very anxious
to please the mother, and looking round at the
children said: &#8220;What a nice little family you have;
you are like a hen surrounded by her chickens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Bibi Fati did not feel at all comfortable at such
a complimentary speech and quickly gave the old
woman some food and sent her about her business.</p>

<p>For a day or two all went well. Then one after
another Rubabeh, Hasan, Riza, and even little
Sakineh sickened and died, probably of some infectious
disease, and the poor mother was left childless and
heartbroken. Nothing would convince her and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
neighbours that the old beggar woman had not caused
the catastrophe by her admiration.</p>

<p>Baby girls do not get such a good welcome as baby
boys. When little Ferang&#299;z Kh&#257;num was born, her
father was staying at a garden a few miles away, and
no one troubled to send him word. &#8220;I would have
sent a message if it had been a boy,&#8221; said the mother,
&#8220;but it is not worth while for a girl. It will do when
he comes home next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Persian fathers and mothers are often very fond of
their little girls, but there is no doubt that they very
much prefer boys. The father and mother, but
especially the mother, are often known by the name
of their son, so much so that sometimes the neighbours
know them by no other name than &#8220;the father of
Hasan,&#8221; the &#8220;mother of &#8216;Ali.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason for preferring boys is that the
girls marry so young, just as they might begin to be
of some use to their mothers; and the father has to
pay a sum of money to his daughter&#8217;s husband on her
marriage. A son, on the other hand, does not
generally marry till he is grown up, and then he almost
invariably brings his little wife home and continues
to live with his parents.</p>

<p>A greater reason is that the Persians are Muhammadans,
as you have already heard, and in a Muhammadan
country the men are allowed to treat the girls
and women very badly, and parents who care at all
for their girls must always feel great anxiety as to
their future.</p>

<p>We shall never get the Persians to treat their girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and women much better till we teach them the religion
of our loving Saviour, Who cares for us all equally
and wants us to be equally kind to one another.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>PERSIAN CLOTHES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Persian</span> boys and girls are white, almost as white as
ourselves, though they generally have black hair and
dark eyes. The chief difference in appearance between
Tommy Jones and &#8216;Ali Muhammad is that Tommy
wears trousers while &#8216;Ali Muhammad appears to wear
a skirt. Tommy&#8217;s sister on the other hand wears a
skirt, and &#8216;Ali Muhammad&#8217;s sister wears trousers.</p>

<p>The fact is that if &#8216;Ali Muhammad is a poor boy, his
trousers are short and so very wide as to be practically
a divided skirt. Indeed they catch like a skirt in
running, so that if he wants to go fast he pulls one
trouser-leg up out of the way. If he wears a coat at
all, it is a long cotton one, or more probably two long
cotton ones, reaching nearly to his knees and adding
to the skirt-like appearance.</p>

<p>The sons of well-to-do men often wear frock coats
with the skirts pleated all round almost like a kilt, so
that in spite of their longer and narrower trousers they
still have a look of wearing skirts.</p>



<p>&#8216;Ali Muhammad&#8217;s girdle too, which binds his coats
to him and prevents their blowing about in the wind,
is more suggestive of a sash than a belt. I once saw
a little boy putting on his girdle on New Year&#8217;s Day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
It was a long folded scarf or <i>sh&#257;l</i> and he put one end
round his waist while his brother took the other to the
far end of the long room and drew it tight. Then my
little friend turned round and round, so winding his
<i>sh&#257;l</i> round him, gradually moving up the room as the
length grew less, and he finished by tucking in the end.
But whether they wear long trousers or short ones, wide
trousers or narrow ones, the boys all fasten them by
drawing them up with a string round the hips&mdash;braces
are not the fashion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">LADIES&#8217; OUT-DOOR AND IN-DOOR COSTUMES</p>

<p>As we have found that, in spite of appearances, &#8216;Ali
Muhammad after all wears trousers, we may perhaps
find that his sister, Rubabeh, wears a skirt, and so indeed
she does, but it is so short as not to be very noticeable
indoors, while out of doors it is completely hidden
by the big baggy over-trousers, gathered in at the
ankles and footed, which she wears when she goes in
the street. An English missionary once suggested to a
young woman that a skirt reaching to the knees would
look better, but she said she was not an old woman
yet. The old women generally wear quiet colours
and long skirts, reaching down to the knee, but young
women and girls like something more dressy. They
like a nice bright-patterned skirt about a foot long,
but wide enough to reach half across the room. This
they draw up with a string over the white cotton
trousers, and the short shirt hangs loose outside. The
shirt is generally white but may be coloured, and a
short coloured jacket is worn over it, varying from
plain coarse cotton to velvet embroidered with gold
and pearls.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>The indoor <i>ch&#257;dar</i>, or &#8220;prayer-<i>ch&#257;dar</i>,&#8221; is often of
pretty print or muslin, and when Rubabeh puts on her
clean white trousers, shirt and headkerchief, with a
bright frill of skirt round the waist and a pretty jacket
and <i>ch&#257;dar</i>, she makes a very bright and effective
picture. But when she goes out she must put on dark
over-trousers which cover everything up to the waist,
and over her head, in place of the pretty prayer
<i>ch&#257;dar</i>, she must throw a large black <i>ch&#257;dar</i> which hangs
over everything, while a long strip of white cotton
hangs down in front of her face with drawn thread
work in front of the eyes, so that she may be able to
see without being seen.</p>

<p>So, unlike our streets, the Persian ones get their
colour from the men and boys, while the women and
girls supply the darker, duller element. Bright blue
is the commonest colour for the men&#8217;s coats, and green
is not uncommon, while, at the New Year, pink, yellow,
lilac and other colours make the streets very gay indeed.</p>

<p>The children are dressed just like their fathers and
mothers, and are little imitation men and women.
The little tots look so funny sometimes; tiny boys
toddling about in long trousers, frockcoats, and grown-up
hats, and wee girls, who cannot yet speak distinctly,
in the long trousers, short skirts and <i>ch&#257;dars</i>
of the women.</p>

<p>It seems to suggest that no great distinction is made
between children and grown-ups, and really there is
not as much difference as we find at home. The
children are taught to take life very seriously and are
treated as little men and women before their time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
so they have no time to grow up into proper men
and women, and the result is that we find the children
too grown-up and the grown-ups too childish.</p>

<p>You will find, roughly speaking, if you look at
animals that the higher the animal, the longer its
childhood lasts, because it has more growing up to
do. Caterpillars and tadpoles look after themselves
from the time of coming out of the egg, mice grow up
in a few weeks, horses in a few years, and man takes
longer to grow up than any animal.</p>

<p>Now Muhammad, the false prophet whom the
Persians believe in and obey, had no such high
standard to set before them, no such high ideal for
them to grow up to, as our Lord Jesus Christ set before
His followers and enables them to grow up to; and
so his religion provides only a short time for growing
up, and stunts instead of assisting the growth both
of individual Muhammadans and of Muhammadan
nations.</p>

<p>But we must get back to our Persian children and
their clothes. Their day-clothes we have seen; what
about their night-clothes? They have none. They
just take off their outer garments and lie down in the
rest, and in the morning they just get up and put on
their outer garments again. Sometimes they do not
put off anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are so tired,&#8221; said some ladies one New Year&#8217;s
morning. &#8220;With all our new clothes on we could not
lie down, we should have crushed them, so we sat up
all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>You wonder why they were so foolish as to put them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
on on New Year&#8217;s Eve in that case, instead of on the
morning of the New Year itself. The reason is simple.
A Persian only puts on new clothes after a bath, and
a bath in Persia is not a mere matter of half an hour; it
takes half a day, and sometimes a whole one. Some
of the richer people have baths in their own houses,
but most people go to the public baths.</p>

<p>All Persian women and girls love a day at the bath,
and will not shorten it if they can possibly help it.
It is something like a Turkish bath, and there they
meet their friends and sit about in steamy rooms,
talking, laughing, gossiping. No wonder they look
forward to it, for a Persian girl has a much more
secluded and restricted life than girls in Europe and
her intercourse with her friends is much less free. One
girl of fifteen told me that except for her weekly visit
to the bath she had only left her house once in a period
of six months, and in her own house she received very
few visitors, the calls of her English missionary friends
being great events for the whole household.</p>

<p>At the bath they wash their hair, dye it with henna,
and plait it up in a dozen or more long plaits which
hang down their backs under the headkerchief and
<i>ch&#257;dar</i>, not to be undone again probably until the next
visit to the bath. The henna is a reddish dye and
though it does not show on black hair it turns fair or
grey hair a carroty red. The newcomer to Persia
wonders to see so much red hair, till he finds that this
is the explanation. But the boys and girls nearly all
have black hair.</p>

<p>Boys have their heads shaved, though sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a handful of hair is left over each ear, or a lock in the
middle of the scalp. This shaving is probably the
reason why Persian boys always keep on their caps
or hats indoors and only take them off to sleep. Instead
of taking off their caps, Persian boys, and girls
too, take off their shoes when they come into a room,
and this, together with the absence of chairs and tables
explains how Persian carpets last a hundred years.
They are actually more valuable after several years
wear than when they were new.</p>

<p>Besides the hair, the fingernails, palms of the hands
and soles of the feet must, by Muhammadan rules, be
dyed with henna. The richer bathers have all these
things done by the bath attendant, but the poorer
ones do it all themselves, and the very poor often omit
the henna, except on special occasions.</p>

<p>Just as no Persian likes to put on clean clothes
without going to the bath, so he will not go to the bath
without putting on clean clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Khanum, give me a new shirt,&#8221; begged one old
woman, displaying a ragged one she had on. &#8220;For
want of one I have not been able to go to the bath
since this was new.&#8221;</p>

<p>But where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way, and some
people who are too poor to have a change of clothes go
to the bath, take off their clothes and wash them, and
then wait in the bath till they are dry.</p>

<p>There is a large tank in which the people wash and
a ceremonial washing requires a dip right under the
water. The usual idea of changing the water is to
take out canfuls to water the tiles round, and then fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
up the tank again with clean water, so simply adding a
little clean water to the dirty.</p>

<p>During a cholera epidemic the Governor of a Persian
town ordered that the bath water should be changed
at least once a month. One cannot help wondering
whether the monthly change was carried out as described
above, and I am sure you would prefer the
little village baths where there is often so small a
tank that no one can get into it, and they ladle out the
water and wash in basins.</p>

<p>The common use of the one tank, with the only
partial changing of the water, and the general carelessness
of infection, make the bath one of the greatest
means of spreading disease.</p>

<p>The Muhammadan religion provides strict rules as
to clothes and baths and washing. In the washings
before prayers it even decides which hand and which
side of the face shall be washed first. And all this
the parents teach the children as carefully as, generally
much more carefully than, such matters as truthfulness,
honesty and kindness.</p>

<p>Here again we see Muhammad giving his people
what we may call &#8220;nursery rules,&#8221; treating them as
children, while our Master expects us to grow up so
that we can arrange these matters for ourselves.</p>

<p>As children we must live under detailed rules, but
always with the object before us of growing up right.
The very fact that the detailed rules of Muhammadanism
are binding through life shows that the
Muhammadan is not expected to grow up as we
understand growing up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>PERSIAN GAMES AND TOYS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is curious to go thousands of miles to Persia&mdash;to
cross vast sandy deserts&mdash;and at last to find little
skirted boys in the mudwalled streets playing tipcat
just like their counterparts in our own cities. Hop-scotch
and duck-stone too are favourite games, and
kites are very popular. The kites are large and square
and fly very well, and the boys often fly them from the
roofs, sending &#8220;messages&#8221; up the string just as our
boys do. There is a regular game of &#8220;wolf&#8221; too,
played almost exactly as it is in many parts of the
world by English-speaking children. I am sorry to
say that pitch and toss and gambling with cards are
very common.</p>

<p>There is nothing like cricket and football, but in
Yezd there is a kind of &#8220;rounders&#8221; which is played
for a fortnight only at the New Year&mdash;the Persian
New Year, that is, in March. Any evening during
that fortnight if you go out into the desert just outside
the town walls you will see a crowd of men and boys,
some playing, some watching. And any day during
that fortnight if you visit the women, some small boy
will proudly show his <i>chaftar</i> or rounders stick. For
a week or two afterwards an occasional <i>chaftar</i> may
be seen but after that it is a puzzle where they disappear
to, not one is to be seen till the next New
Year.</p>

<p>The little girls in Persia, as everywhere else, depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
largely on dolls. The dolls are home made&mdash;rag-dolls
without much shape, with the features worked in fine
cross-stitch, and dressed of course, as Persians. Good
European dolls are great treasures, even to the women,
and I knew one rich lady who had eight very nice ones
all for herself.</p>

<p>In Shiraz they make wooden horses for the children
and little models of the <i>kajavehs</i> or covered panniers in
which women and children often travel. In Yezd,
where the workers in clay are cleverer than the
carpenters, little model <i>kuzehs</i> or waterpots are
commoner and clay money-boxes and nightingales.
Roughly moulded and gaily painted clay animals
and men too, are made in quantities&mdash;but only at the
&#8220;Festival of the Sacrifice&#8221; when a camel is sacrificed.
At the time of this festival there are stalls and shops in
the bazaars full of clay toys and toy drums, but they
cannot be got at any other time of year, and as clay
animals are quickly broken they are only to be seen
for a very short time. Among the toys may sometimes
be seen a figure evidently copied from an
Italian statuette of the Virgin and Child&mdash;copied by
Muhammadans without any idea of what it represents.
But when all is said the games and toys are very few
in Persia, as compared with those you are accustomed
to. Perhaps they are not so much needed there.
The grown-ups are so childish that it is no great hardship
to a child to practice grown-up ways instead of
playing games of its own. There is so much in ordinary
grown-up life that is really a very good substitute for a
game&mdash;the elaborate greetings to be gone through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
with each person in turn according to their importance,
the tea served in tiny cups no bigger than a child&#8217;s
teaset, the sweet-eating, the pressing of roseheads into
the visitor&#8217;s hand, or the more elaborate arrangement
of stiff sticks closely covered with roses, the presentation
of tiny unripe first-fruits, of melon seeds or nuts
ornamented with fluffy bits of silk, of oranges inlaid
with velvet, all these would seem a very attractive
game to a child. Perhaps they really prefer to join
in the games their elders play in earnest rather than
play their own in jest. The conversation too is seldom
over their heads, but generally interests them as much
as their parents. The entertainments of the elders are
of a kind to suit the children too. What child does
not enjoy the Fifth of November with its Guy Fawkes,
its fireworks, and its bonfires? and the Persians, too,
have their firework day, when they burn not Guy
Fawkes, but &#8216;Omar, the Muhammadan leader who
conquered Persia. They do not burn him, because he
conquered Persia, but because he was <i>Khalif</i> or head
of the Muhammadans, and the Persians say that &#8216;Ali,
Muhammad&#8217;s son-in-law, ought to have been <i>Khalif</i>
and that &#8216;Omar was a usurper. There are torchlight
processions, in which &#8216;Omar&#8217;s effigy is carried, bonfires
illuminations, and fireworks in plenty.</p>

<p>All the year round fireworks and illuminations are
very popular, so much so that the main work of
the Government Arsenals seems to be the manufacture
of fireworks. Another very popular form of
entertainment is the <i>ruzehkh&#257;n&#299;]</i>, or religious reading.
It is considered a very pious act for a man to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<i>ruzehkh&#257;n&#299;</i> in his house in the two months of Muharram,
and his friends come in crowds and greatly prefer it to
an ordinary party. Muharram is the time of mourning
for Husain and Hasan, Muhammad&#8217;s grandsons.</p>

<p>The courtyard is crowded with people sitting on the
ground, and as the professional reader recites the story
of the death of Husain and Hasan the people sway
their bodies to and fro to the rhythm and gradually
work up their excitement. Then they all begin to
beat on their bare chests with the open hand and raise
a wail that gradually grows in strength, till the wailing
and the sound of the blows can be heard several streets
off and the tears stream down their cheeks. It is
very exciting, and grown-ups and children alike enjoy
it thoroughly.</p>

<p>But <i>the</i> day of the year is the day of the death of
Husain when the <i>nakhl</i> is carried and the great
passion play of the death of Husain and Hasan is
played.</p>

<p>This is a general holiday and all through the early
part of the day, the villagers come trooping in to the
towns. The streets are now full and processions pass
along them carrying the <i>nakhls</i> from the squares outside
the smaller mosques. In some towns, too, they
carry <i>alams</i>, or long poles with a series of handkerchiefs
tied to them. When the processions from two different
quarters of the town meet there is generally a struggle,
often ending in a free fight; so both <i>alams</i> and <i>nakhls</i>
are now forbidden in some towns.</p>

<p>I only once met a procession myself, and then it
most politely halted to allow me to pass comfortably.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>The smaller processions being over, everyone crowds
to the large squares to see the carrying of the great
<i>nakhls</i> of the big mosques.</p>

<p>The <i>nakhls</i> are wooden frameworks carried on poles
and hung on one side with looking-glasses, on the other
with daggers. Those in the large squares are of
immense weight. They are said on this day to be
carried across the square by Fatimeh, Muhammad&#8217;s
daughter, but it is a work of great merit to help her,
so as many as can possibly get within reach of the
poles join in the work, and the <i>nakhl</i> moves across the
square. But the afternoon is the best part when the
great play of the death of Husain and Hasan is acted.
Then, indeed, there is wailing and beating of breasts.
&#8220;I enjoy it more than anything in the year,&#8221; one lady
told me.</p>

<p>One year there was a little boy dangerously ill with
inflammation of the lungs when the great day came
round. It was considered quite out of the question for
any of the family to stay away from the play to nurse
him, and being a boy he was not likely to obey the
woman servant who was being left in charge of the
house. &#8220;He would have been all over the roof trying
to get a glimpse of the play,&#8221; his mother said, &#8220;and
probably would have fallen off, so we had to take him.&#8221;
So they took a mattress for him, and he lay and listened
to the play from a gallery, and of course got up to
watch the exciting parts. It very nearly killed him,
but they seemed to feel they had taken the only reasonable
course, and he eventually recovered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>PERSIAN SWEETS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a Persian town there is a curious arrangement of
the shops. All the shops where one kind of article is
sold are generally grouped together in one street or
<i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i>. To buy shoes we go to the shoe bazaar, for
cooking pots to the copper bazaar.</p>

<p>The copper or brass bazaar is almost always worth
a visit in a Persian town. It is a long roofed-in street
with a continuous row of small shops on either side.
The &#8220;shop&#8221; consists of a lock-up room with a small
mud platform in front of it, raised a foot or two above
the street. On this platform are two or three stumps
on which the pots are placed for hammering, for after
being heated over a charcoal brazier they are hammered
and beaten into the required shape, thickness and
pattern. On nearly every platform is a man, sometimes
two or three men and boys, hammering each on
his copper pot and the noise produced by a hundred
or more men hammering vigorously on copper vessels,
which give different notes according to size, shape and
thickness, is deafening, but not wholly disagreeable.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>But there is another bazaar well worth a visit in
Yezd at any rate. The shops here have counters rising
in tiers, so as to display the very tempting goods to
advantage. The goods themselves are chiefly laid out
on huge round copper trays, about a yard across and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
very heavy, made in the bazaar we have just left, but
whitened over, as all copper vessels are.</p>

<p>Surely we are in Fairyland at last. Shop after
shop shows tier upon tier of the most delicious sweets
in the most tempting profusion. Here is <i>pashmak</i>,
looking like cotton wool and tasting something like
butter creams. There are two or three kinds of almond
toffee, or <i>s&#333;n</i>&mdash;some with green pistachio nuts in it.
Huge fondants, or <i>l&#333;z</i>, in diamond-shaped cakes, nearly
as large as the ordinary penny fancy cakes in England,
alternate with similar cakes of green <i>pari-t&#257;&#8217;&#363;s</i> (peacock&#8217;s
feathers), and brown <i>b&#257;ghalav&#257;</i>, richer and
stickier than either.</p>

<p>Those white <i>nuqls</i> are delicious burnt almonds, which
seem to melt away in your mouth, the long ones have
strips of cocoa-nut instead of almonds, and the little
round ones burnt peas. Here are little flat round
cakes of <i>gaz</i>, a kind of nougat only made in Isfahan,
but sent to all the towns in Persia. One variety of <i>gaz</i>
contains little sticks of a gum which is supposed to
cure rheumatism, a very pleasant remedy.</p>

<p>There is a great bowl a foot across, and over an inch
thick made wholly of sugar candy, which has taken
the shape of the basin in which it crystallised, and in
the middle of which three long sticks of sugar candy
stand up high above the top. Such a bowl a kind
Persian friend sent to a missionary&#8217;s little boy, when
he was a few days old, to provide him with &#8220;sugar-candy
water,&#8221; which is considered particularly good
for young babies. These are only a few of the sweets,
there are too many to mention all. Some kinds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
only made in the fast month of Ramaz&#257;n, and others
only at the New Year. The sweets are delicious but
they are as a rule very simple and very sweet. So the
Persians do not hand them round in little paper bags,
nor even in pretty little boxes; they pile them on
plates and dishes, as we do cakes; and, as you have
seen, many of them are as large as cakes. When you
go to visit a Persian, you have not tea and cakes, but
tea and sweets. For a quiet call on quiet people, two
or three plates of sweets are enough, but at a regular
sweet-eating at a big house, one or two great trays will
be set on the ground before the guests, each with five
dishes of sweets on it, each dish holding about a pound
and a half to two pounds of sweets. The Persian
women are often very pressing with their sweets, even
to the point of putting them into their visitors&#8217; mouths,
and in their hospitality they sometimes over-estimate
the size of the mouth. Often too, the guests are made
to carry home what is left, or a part of it, tied up in a
handkerchief. This is so common that where the
European is shy of pressing the custom, the Persian
ladies will sometimes carry home the remains of
European dishes out of courtesy, to show that they
have appreciated them. This custom probably exists
and has existed in many Eastern countries, and may
very likely be the reason why Joseph gave Benjamin
five times as much as his other brothers. Benjamin
was probably intended to take what was over away
with him.</p>

<p>I was visiting some Persian women one day, and
they asked for my handkerchief to wrap up the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the sweets in. I apologised for being unable
to take them as I had not a clean handkerchief,
on which they all eagerly assured me that it did not
matter in the least, they would be quite content with
the one I had. The Persian <i>dastm&#257;l</i> or handkerchief
serves every purpose except the one we connect it with.
Your Persian servant, always carries a large coloured
one in his pocket. He dusts the rooms with it, puts
his purchases from the <i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i> into it, polishes your
boots with it before you enter a Persian house, and
carries home sweets or nuts in it.</p>

<p>At the New Year, there are twenty-one days set
apart for holiday making and visiting, and in every
house tea and sweets and sherbet are ready for all
comers. In those twenty-one days people are expected
to visit all their friends, and even with strict
moderation the most sweet-loving schoolboy of your
acquaintance would probably be glad of a rest by the
end of the three weeks.</p>

<p>All this sounds delightful, doesn&#8217;t it? But unfortunately
it is more for the grown-ups than for the
children. The children like sweets well enough and
get a good many, but they have not the same opportunities
as the grown-ups.</p>

<p>But sweets have their serious uses among the
Persians. We have seen that rheumatism may be
cured with nougat, and we find that sweets in general
are very strengthening. It is not at all uncommon,
after a small operation or the extraction of a tooth, to
see the friends pressing sugar or sweets into the
patient&#8217;s mouth, to restore her strength after the shock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and in the same way after a fright a few sweets make
you feel much better.</p>

<p>Bread and sweets are not an uncommon dinner,
and a child who was ordered by the doctor to take
plenty of milk because it was good strengthening food,
was given three-quarters of a pound of sweets for her
dinner instead. &#8220;So much more strengthening than
milk,&#8221; the mother said.</p>

<p>Persian sweets are very soft and in the dry climate
quickly get hard and lose their first freshness, and
to offer a Persian stale sweets is like offering you
stale cakes. They are at their best only on the
day they are made, and the servant sent to buy sweets
will sit down with his tray of plates at the shop-door
and wait till the new sweets are ready, when they can
be put quite fresh and new on the plates on which they
are to be served. In Yezd, where the best sweets are
made, our servants seemed to regard the moving of
sweets to a fresh plate much as we should the removal
of a pie to a fresh pie-dish, and many sorts are certainly
the worse for being shifted after they have got cold.
All better-class Persians make their own sweets at home
and consider &#8220;shop sweets&#8221; very inferior.</p>

<p>The fame of Persian sherbet has spread far, and
nearly every visitor to Persia looks forward to a treat
when he tastes it. But it by no means comes up to
expectation. It is often made fresh in the presence
of the guests, so the recipe is no secret. A sugar loaf
is put in a basin, by preference a pot pourri bowl, and
cold water is poured over it, and it is allowed to melt
with an occasional stir. A little rosewater is then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
added to flavour it, and it is handed round in glasses,
with ice if possible. At meals, however, the bowl
is placed on the tablecloth,&mdash;there is no table,&mdash;and a
large carved wooden spoon is passed to each in turn
from which to drink it.</p>

<p>Sometimes lime or orange juice is offered as an
alternative flavour to rosewater, which makes it much
more palatable to Europeans. But insipid as the
ordinary sherbet is, it seems the most delicious compound
imaginable when it is taken, well-iced, after a
long walk with the thermometer at 100° in the shade.
Perhaps that is why it has been so much praised.</p>

<p>Another favourite beverage is <i>sekunjibin</i>, which is
like raspberry vinegar with mint instead of raspberry.</p>

<p>Sherbet and good things to eat figure largely in
Muhammad&#8217;s description of the joys of Heaven.
His ideals were ideals that did not need much growing
up to. He expected his followers to have childish ideas
and childish desires even in heaven.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>PERSIAN PRAYERS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Persian</span> boys and girls need not say their prayers
till they are seven years old. Sometimes they begin
sooner, but that is considered unnecessarily good.
They are not to be beaten for not saying them till they
are ten, and I have not seen many children under ten
years old saying their prayers. We cannot remember
learning to pray, for as soon as we could understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
anything about God, we were taught to ask Him to
take care of us, to ask Him to forgive us when we were
naughty, and to help us to be good, to thank Him for
His kindness and His gifts. It is so simple that a
child of three or four can come to God in this way, we
need not wait till we are seven to bring simple petitions
to our Heavenly Father. But little Ghul&#257;m Husain&#8217;s
prayers are far from simple. He has first to learn to
wash his face, hands and arms, and feet and legs.
&#8220;That does not need much teaching,&#8221; you say. &#8220;He
can surely wash himself at that age.&#8221; But there is a
right and a wrong way of washing in Persia before
prayers. There is a right and a wrong side of your face to
wash first, there is a right and a wrong hand and a right
and a wrong foot to wash first. If a Persian is very
religious and careful there is even a right and a wrong
side of his arm and leg to wash first, but few Persian
children are as careful as that. No soap is wanted,
just plain water, or, if there is no water, sand. So our
our little Ghul&#257;m Husain learns his washings, and now
he is ready to learn the prayers themselves, which are
all in Arabic so that he does not understand them.</p>




<p>He is shown the direction of Mecca to which he must
always turn when saying them, and he is taught when
to stand, when to kneel, when to bow himself till his
forehead touches the ground, and when to make
various gestures. And when he has learnt all this he
is ready to begin saying his prayers regularly, and he
is told that if he says them correctly, and with the
right movements, they will be pleasing to God, and
count as good works. He must say them three times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a day, and he cannot choose his time. When the
prayer-call sounds from the mosque roofs, and is
taken up by people on the house roofs, he must leave
what he is doing, and wash and say his prayers&mdash;the
same prayers every time. First in the early dawn,
before sunrise, he hears the call, and he must get out
of bed for washing and prayers. In the summer it may
be as early as four o&#8217;clock, in winter not till six or
seven. Then, again, when the sun-dial on the mosque
marks noon, the call is heard, and again at sunset,
and each time the prayers must be said within half
an hour. Half an hour&#8217;s grace is allowed, so if
Persians have visitors when the prayer-call sounds,
they are able to go in turns to say their prayers, so as
not to leave the visitor alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PERSIANS AT PRAYER</p>

<p>Some Persians are very particular about their prayers,
but many are not so particular and will leave them
unsaid if there is any excuse; and, as in other religions,
there are people who neglect their prayers altogether.</p>

<p>There are many who are very regular in their prayers
and very particular as to the direction towards which
they face, and their positions and gestures at various
parts of the prayers, but who are not in the least really
reverent over them. Medical missionaries especially
cannot always choose the time of their visits, and
sometimes cannot avoid prayer-time. Then, instead
of going to a quiet room, the Muhammadans often say
their prayers in the room where the missionary is being
entertained, and the conversation is never hushed for
them; indeed, they will often themselves join in the conversation
even while they are supposed to be praying.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>One day a party of women from a Mull&#257;&#8217;s house
were visiting a missionary, when the evening prayer-call
sounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall hardly have time to get home in half an
hour,&#8221; the Mull&#257;&#8217;s wife said. &#8220;May I say my prayers
here?&#8221; The missionary readily gave her consent,
but only the one lady availed herself of the permission,
and, having asked in which direction Mecca lay, placed
her prayer-stone in front of her and knelt down to say
her prayers.</p>

<p>The rest went on talking loudly round her, calling
out and stretching across just in front of her in a
way that must have attracted her attention. When
the missionary asked them to be quiet they assured
her that their friend did not mind, and she herself
turned from her prayers to beg them not to stop for
her. But the missionary insisted on quiet until the
prayers were over, explaining that it was not a
question of respect to the lady, but of reverence to
God, and, in the conversation which naturally followed,
she was able to tell them some of the Bible teaching on
prayer.</p>

<p>The prayer-stone is a small slab of about an inch
and a half across, made of the earth of Kerbela where
Husain, the grandson of Muhammad was killed. The
Kerbela earth is said to be scented with &#8220;the blood of
the martyrs,&#8221; and is much used for prayer-stones and
rosaries.</p>

<p>A Muhammadan places his prayer-stone on the
ground before him when he says his prayers. If
anyone passes in front of a Muhammadan as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
is saying his prayers it is supposed to greatly
reduce their value. But if he puts the prayer-stone
in front of him it acts as a church wall
and cuts him off from the outside world, and nothing
passing on the far side of the stone can affect his
prayers. If he has no prayer-stone he sometimes
draws a line on the earth instead, and this is said to
be just as effectual. At certain points in the prayers
the forehead must touch the ground, and when a
prayer-stone is used the forehead touches the prayer-stone,
and perhaps the holiness of the earth touched
is supposed to increase the value of the prayers.</p>

<p>After the regular Arabic prayers have been said
any further prayers may be added in Persian, but the
people seem generally to content themselves with the
set prayers and to be shy of adding any of their own
wording, and in any case the Arabic prayers are considered
the more important.</p>

<p>Although the Persians use their prayers like charms,
repeating forms which convey to them no meaning,
yet they have great faith in the efficacy of prayers as
charms. One Sunday a Persian woman brought her
little girl to the doctor&#8217;s house, covered with smallpox
and very ill. Finding that it was service time
she thought the prayers might do the child good,
so she put off asking for medicine till later, and, hiding
the child under her <i>ch&#257;dar</i>, she sat down among the
other women and children through the whole service.</p>

<p>I have never known Persians refuse Christian
prayers over their sick friends, and generally they
join in with a heartfelt <i>Amen</i> to prayers which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
have been able to understand. At one house where
they were afraid of the medicine they entreated the
missionary doctor to come daily to pray over the
patient. The patient was one of five cases of typhoid
fever in the house. The others were being treated by
a Persian doctor, but this woman had very serious
complications and seemed so unlikely to recover that
he suggested their calling in a Christian doctor for her.
For many days she lay quite unconscious, but every
day the missionary walked a mile and a half to pray
beside her, and every day the same entreaty was repeated,
&#8220;You will come again to-morrow, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; And the prayers were answered, for at last
signs of improvement appeared, and the poor woman
was restored to health and strength again.</p>

<p>God has given us a wonderful privilege in allowing
us to come freely to Him as our Father, and lay all
our joys and sorrows, troubles and perplexities before
Him.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oh! What peace we often forfeit,</div>
<div class="indent">Oh! What needless pain we bear,</div>
<div class="verse">All because we do not carry</div>
<div class="indent">Everything to God in prayer!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And, if that is true of us, how much more true it is
of the Muhammadans who do not know God as their
Father, who do not know that God is love, who do
not know that they may carry everything to God in
prayer. When we think of the want of peace, the
needless pain, the sin, the sorrow, the wretchedness in
Muhammadan lands, and yet see the people so ready
to pray, surely it is our plain and urgent duty to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
them <i>how</i> to pray, as our Lord has taught us, and to
teach them <i>to Whom</i> they must pray&mdash;not to an unknowable,
unloving Allah, but to a tender, pitying
Father, Who so loved them that He gave His only
begotten Son to die for their salvation.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>FASTING AND PILGRIMAGES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> month in every year Muhammadans have to fast.</p>

<p>Persian boys begin to fast at twelve years old, but
the girls have to begin at nine. Sometimes they
begin sooner if they want to store up merit early.
But even little four-year-old Ibrahim, who is considered
too young to join in the fast, shares it to a certain
degree. For no one is going to cook anything for him
or make him his usual cup of tea when they may not
share it. He gets a bit of dry bread and a drink of
water when he wants it, but little more all through the
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me hungry to see him eating,&#8221; his mother
said.</p>

<p>The name of the fast-month is Ramaz&#257;n, and
through Ramaz&#257;n it is often difficult to get eggs, because
the sweetmakers buy them up to make sweets.
It is a great month for sweets, and there are several
kinds that are only made in Ramaz&#257;n; and, so far from
having &#8220;self-denial boxes,&#8221; as many Christians do in
Lent, the more devout Muhammadan servants ask
for an advance of wages to buy better food in Ramaz&#257;n.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>This all seems strange in a fast-month, but a
Muhammadan fast only lasts from dawn to dark.
At night people may eat what they like, and they take
full advantage of the permission and have nightly
feasts, ending up with a great feast on the last night.</p>

<p>Boys and girls are not late for supper in Ramaz&#257;n.
They gather round the tablecloth as the time draws
near, ready to start directly the signal is given that
it is dark. In towns there is generally a gun fired, and
at the sound of the gun the meal is begun in every
house.</p>

<p>One day such a party was waiting round the supper,
listening for the gun, and they got hungrier and
hungrier, but they heard no gun and waited on. At
last they realised that the wind had carried the sound
away from them, and they had fasted far longer than
they need have done. This was bad enough, but another
family fared worse, for they overslept themselves in
the morning, and woke to find they had missed their
breakfast and must eat nothing till night.</p>

<p>People might differ as to when it was dark, so a test
has been appointed&mdash;as long as you can distinguish a
black thread from a white one it is light, and you must
fast.</p>

<p>It does not sound a very difficult fast, and in winter,
when the days are short, it is not so bad, but on a long
summer day it is very hard. No food, no drink, and
a blazing sun all day. It takes a plucky boy or girl
to get through it without complaining. It is no wonder
that in Ramaz&#257;n &#8220;bed-time&#8221; is forgotten and all
the children sit up half the night and sleep half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
day&mdash;the longer they can sleep in the day the better,
poor little things. Towards evening tempers are apt
not to be very good, but everyone enjoys the night.</p>

<p>No one wants to work in Ramaz&#257;n; they do not want
to get more hungry than they need; and, of course, the
schools are all closed.</p>

<p>The dispensaries and hospitals are nearly empty, for
the taking of medicine, or the use of drops for the eyes
or ears, would be a breaking of the fast, and there was
a great discussion once as to whether having a tooth
out would have the same effect. It seems curious to
have to tell the people to take their medicine twice a
night instead of twice a day.</p>

<p>After Ramaz&#257;n the dispensaries are full of patients
who have made themselves ill by fasting all day and
overeating themselves at night.</p>

<p>Besides the younger children there are a good many
other people who get off the fast. Opium-eaters need
not fast; travellers need not fast on a journey; sick
people can get a dispensation from a mulla. A great
many people take advantage of this, and make a
small ailment an excuse for not fasting, but they are
supposed to make it up at some other time of year.</p>

<p>If anyone forgets and thoughtlessly breaks his fast
no great harm is done, but he must fast an extra day
in the year to make up for it. Some people &#8220;forget&#8221;
every day, but such people do not usually make it up
at any other time.</p>

<p>Just before Ramaz&#257;n a good many people are fasting,
having put off to the last minute the making-up
of the fast days for the previous Ramaz&#257;n.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>People who want to be very good sometimes fast on
Saints&#8217; Days too, and one old lady always fasted on the
day when Muhammadan tradition says that our Lord
Jesus Christ was born.</p>

<p>Another way in which Muhammadans think they can
gain merit is by making a pilgrimage to some holy place.</p>

<p>Pilgrimages may be made to any place where a
Muhammadan saint is buried, but there are four
special places to which the Persians go&mdash;Qum, Meshed,
Kerbela, and Mecca. Mecca is considered far the
greatest place of pilgrimage, because it is the place
where Muhammad was born. A pilgrimage to Qum
gives the pilgrim no commonly used title, but if he goes
to Meshed he becomes <i>Meshedi</i>; if to Kerbela, <i>Kerbel&#257;&#299;</i>;
and, if to Mecca, <i>H&#257;j&#299;</i>; and a <i>H&#257;j&#299;</i> always uses his title.
In accosting a working-class stranger it is polite to
call him <i>Meshedi</i>, and more polite to call him <i>Kerbel&#257;&#299;</i>,
but <i>H&#257;j&#299;</i> is too important a title to be used in this way.
Quite little boys and girls are sometimes <i>H&#257;j&#299;s</i>&mdash;they
have been taken to Mecca by their parents.</p>

<p>But the people who most frequently go are the
business men and the old people. The business men
manage to make a business journey, which will include
Mecca, and the old people, old women especially, are
often sent as a polite way of getting rid of them
when they are cranky and ill-tempered. If they die
on the way, they are supposed to go straight to Heaven.
A good many do die on the road, which is a very
rough one. It reminds one of the man who said of his
enemies that he should like to convert them and send
them to Heaven before they had time to backslide.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>One day in a <i>caravansarai</i>, or native inn, I met a
young woman who told me a friend who was going on
a pilgrimage had passed through her village and had
persuaded her to come too. She was going to walk
all the way and trust to charity for food, as many
pilgrims do, for it is considered a greater work of
merit to give to a pilgrim than to an ordinary beggar.
The journey would take several months.</p>

<p>I asked her a few questions.</p>

<p>Yes, she said, she had a husband and children.</p>

<p>&#8220;And are they with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they are in my village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the children grown-up then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, they are quite little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who is going to take care of them while you
are away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know. There was no time to make arrangements.
I had not even time to tell my husband I was
going. He was at work. My friends tell me it will be a
very great work of merit if I go. What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>We had a long talk, and I believe she went back the
same evening to her home. If so, she would get back
within twenty-four hours of having left it.</p>

<p>The Muhammadans themselves generally allow
that they are no more agreeable or kind or truthful
or good after their pilgrimages&mdash;at least those who
do not go say so freely. They even have a proverb:
&#8220;If your friend has been to Mecca, trust him not.
If he has been there twice, avoid him. But if he has
made the pilgrimage the third time, flee from him as
you would from Satan.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>Even dead people make pilgrimages, generally to
Qum, or, if they are very important people, to Kerbela.
I have not been to Kerbela, but I have been to Qum,
and we met quite a number of corpses going to the
burying-ground outside the big mosque. Sometimes
the relations bring them, but often they cannot
afford the journey and pay a muleteer to take them,
and to pay the fees, which are very large. Sometimes
the muleteers bury the bodies elsewhere and pocket the
fees.</p>

<p>Qum itself is considered such a holy city that they
do not allow dogs inside it.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>SAV&#256;BS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a little Persian book, which many of the little
boys learn to read, called &#8220;Sad Hik&#257;yat&#8221; or &#8220;A
Hundred Stories.&#8221; Some of the stories are very like
Æsop&#8217;s Fables, and they are all supposed to teach the
children something. One story tells them that at the
end of the world God will take a great pair of scales,
and as each person comes up for judgment God will put
his good deeds in one scale and his evil deeds in the
other. If the good deeds weigh heaviest he will go
to Heaven, if his evil deeds weigh the balance down he
will go to Hell.</p>

<p>These good deeds are called <i>sav&#257;bs</i>, and every Persian,
whether child or grown-up, hopes to get to Heaven by
doing enough <i>sav&#257;bs</i> to outweigh his sins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>So a little Persian boy or girl is not taught to try to
always do right or to always try to please and serve
God, but only to do enough right to outweigh the
wrong he does, and if he feels he has done wrong
instead of confessing his sin to God and asking His
forgiveness he simply tries to balance it by a good deed.</p>

<p>And what a Persian boy or girl is taught of what
is right and wrong is very different from all you have
learnt. First there is a definite list of sins, which they
can learn by heart, and nothing outside of this list is
considered a &#8220;sin,&#8221; though other things which are not
right may be called &#8220;errors,&#8221; which is a much less
strong word.</p>

<p>As to good deeds there is more difference of opinion.
One of the &#8220;Hundred Stories&#8221; deals with this point.</p>

<p>A man was travelling in the desert and came to a
well. He dismounted, drove a stable-pin into the
ground, and tied his horse to it while he ate his meal.
When he resumed his journey he left the pin in the
ground that other travellers coming there might tie
their horses to it. Presently a man on foot came
along, and, not seeing the pin, knocked his foot against
it and hurt himself. He pulled up the pin and threw
it into the well lest any one else should hurt himself in
the same way. A discussion arose as to which of the
two had done a <i>sav&#257;b</i>, the man who drove the nail
in or the man who took it out, and finally a learned
and holy man was consulted. After much thought
he gave it as his opinion that both had done <i>sav&#257;bs</i>.</p>

<p>Every little act of kindness is a <i>sav&#257;b</i>, and this encourages
good nature and kindliness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>The children are taught to look out for chances of
doing a kind action and so balancing their wrong-doing.
But at the same time they are taught to think that if
they do a certain number of kind deeds it will not
matter if they do wrong at other times. Little
Rajab &#8216;Ali, the muleteer&#8217;s boy, would run to fasten up
the trailing head-rope of another man&#8217;s mule, he would
lend a helping hand to some stranger whose donkey
had fallen under its load, and between whiles he would
treat his own mules and donkeys most cruelly. He
thought his cruelty did not matter, because he had been
kind as well.</p>

<p>A dishonest lad will try to wipe out his dishonesty
by being regular with his prayers or by an extra day&#8217;s
fast. A man who has cheated someone of ten <i>kr&#257;ns</i>
will give a <i>kr&#257;n</i> to a beggar and consider his account
settled. One man tried to atone for the most outrageous
extortion and injustice by spending <i>part</i> of his
ill-earned gains on good roads for the villagers and a
free school, while all the time he made no pretence of
giving up his evil ways. Those he had injured complained
that now he would escape the punishment of
God.</p>

<p>The Persians seem unable to realise the possibility
of any other motive for good works. When the
missionaries first went to Yezd and opened a medical
mission, the people said, &#8220;What terribly wicked people
they must be to have to do so much good.&#8221;</p>

<p>One curious result of this idea of winning Heaven
and securing better places there by good works is
that it almost destroys gratitude. The beggar feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that he has helped you one step up in Heaven by
accepting your alms; then surely he has done you
more good than you have done him, and why should
he be grateful to you?</p>

<p>The patients who are treated free at the dispensary
have the same feeling; the doctor improved their bodily
state, but they have improved his spiritual position.</p>

<p>It is considered a special work of merit to do anything
for a <i>Seyid</i>, that is, a descendant of Muhammad,
so everyone tries to be kind to <i>Seyids</i>, and they are so
spoilt and are made so much of that they are generally
unbearably selfish, and think themselves the most
important people in the world.</p>

<p>Often in the dispensary the doctor is exhorted to do
his utmost or to break through some rule because the
patient is a <i>Seyid</i>, and they are incredulous and rather
shocked when they are told that an ordinary patient&#8217;s
pain is just as great as a <i>Seyid&#8217;s</i>, and that all must be
taken in their turn.</p>

<p>Another result of this doctrine of works of merit,
or <i>sav&#257;bs</i>, as they call them, is that even when a
Muhammadan seems straight and honest and altogether
a good fellow you cannot entirely trust him,
because he has so many good works to his credit that
he feels a few sins do not matter, they are more than
paid for beforehand.</p>

<p>A Persian&#8217;s idea of what is a <i>sav&#257;b</i> is sometimes
curious. Prayers, fasting, pilgrimages, and the reading
of the Quran are, of course, all considered works of merit.</p>

<p>Marrying your father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s daughter is a
<i>sav&#257;b</i>, though there is no particular merit in marrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
your father&#8217;s sister&#8217;s daughter or your mother&#8217;s
brother&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p>Some Persian women inquired one day what each
of three missionaries living together ate for breakfast,
and hearing that two had eggs, while the third had not,
they nodded at each other, as much as to say, &#8220;I told
you so,&#8221; and remarked, &#8220;It is a <i>sav&#257;b</i>. She wants to
get a higher place in Heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giving money to beggars is always considered a
<i>sav&#257;b</i>, but it is considered a greater <i>sav&#257;b</i> on Thursday
than on any other day. Friday is the Muhammadan
holy day, and they call Thursday &#8220;the Eve of Friday,&#8221;
and on Thursday the beggars all call out as you pass,
&#8220;It is the Eve of Friday; give me a copper.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grown-up beggars generally, but not always,
sit by the roadside begging, but the children run
alongside of you and are often very persistent. There
are nearly always beggars at the gate of any town,
asking those who are starting on a journey to give
them an alms, and so secure safety on their journey.
If Jericho was anything like a Persian town it was
most natural that our Lord should find one blind
beggar as He went into the town (St Luke 18, v. 35),
and one or two more as He came out by another gate
(St Matt. 20, v. 30), and that they should address Him
in almost exactly the same language.</p>

<p>Begging is often a very paying occupation, for so
many people feel that they have sins to make up for,
that the cry, &#8220;Give me a copper. It will be a <i>sav&#257;b</i>,&#8221;
is a difficult one to refuse, especially if the copper is
only worth a farthing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>So well does begging pay that on more than one
occasion the mothers and wives of well-to-do tradesmen
have been detected in old <i>ch&#257;dars</i> begging in the
streets and at houses. The difficulty of recognising a
woman who is completely covered up with a black
<i>ch&#257;dar</i> makes disguise easy.</p>

<p>During the massacre of the Babis, a dissenting sect
of Muhammadans, in 1903, it was considered a <i>sav&#257;b</i>
to kill a Babi, but some of the kindlier people thought
it also a <i>sav&#257;b</i> to save a life, even if it was a Babi&#8217;s.
One man is said to have been seen with a prisoner, in
great perplexity, saying, &#8220;I am quite sure of Hell for
my sins, unless I can do a big <i>sav&#257;b</i>; if this man is a
Babi, my chance of salvation is to kill him, but I am
not sure whether he is, and if I kill a true believer I shall
be worse off than ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there are <i>sav&#257;bs</i> of a very different sort.</p>

<p>There was an old woman friendless and ill, and a
Persian man found her in the street, too ill to get home
to the one wretched room where she lived all alone.
He did not know her, but he decided to undertake the
<i>sav&#257;b</i>. He sent across the town for a medical missionary,
knowing the Christians had the reputation of
never refusing to help the sick poor. He stayed there
till the doctor arrived, and said that if she would visit
the old woman and provide the medicines he would send
for them, and would provide the food and nursing, and
this he did until the old woman died a few days later.</p>

<p>The adoption of a destitute child is not an uncommon
<i>sav&#257;b</i>, and these children are often treated very well
and given a good start in life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>A kind action, as we have seen, is always considered
a <i>sav&#257;b</i>, whether it is helping a fallen mule to get up,
giving a copper to a beggar, or tending a friendless
stranger in sickness and death. We may almost say
that this is the one redeeming point of a Persian&#8217;s
religion. Generally speaking, Persians are not improved
by their religious ideas, for the stronger their
religious ideas are the worse their lives are, and what
one most admires in Persian character is least in
accordance with their religious beliefs.</p>

<p class="caption">READING THE QURAN TO THE SICK</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>MUHAMMADAN CHARMS AND SUPERSTITIONS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Muhammad</span> did not write down his teaching, for he
could not write, but his followers learnt it by heart,
and wrote it down, and after his death it was collected
into one book called the Quran. It was arranged
in a haphazard way, and probably the early chapters
were really spoken last, and the later ones first. However,
the Muhammadans believe it to be, as it now
stands, the Word of God, and they treat it with great
respect. When they pick the book up or lay it down
they put it first to the forehead and then to the lips,
and they hold it in both hands. Many Christians might
learn from them to treat God&#8217;s Word more reverently.
They consider it a work of merit to read the Quran
or listen to it, and they read it over their sick folk in
hopes of curing them. But perhaps the commonest
and most popular edition is a two-inch hexagonal one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
which is almost illegible. This is sewn up in two little
round or hexagonal cases, each containing half, and
is worn on the arms to keep off evil of every kind.
The cases may be plain leather or cloth, or they may
be more elaborate and ornamental, or silver cases may
be used with texts from the Quran engraved upon them.</p>



<p>Smaller and cheaper charms are made of texts from
the Quran enclosed in the same way.</p>

<p>These charms, and also beads made from the blue
clay of the holy city of Qum, are used for animals
as well as people, especially young mules. I once
had a charm given me for a kitten.</p>

<p>Children often wear a very large number of charms
sewn on to the cap or hung on a chain round the neck,
as they are supposed to be much more susceptible
than grown-up people to evil influences. One quaint-looking
charm is a little cloth camel, Abraham&#8217;s
camel, sewn on the cap.</p>

<p>What the Persians fear more than anything for their
children is the evil eye, and it is especially to protect
them from this that they cover them with charms.
They say there are certain people who have an &#8220;evil
eye.&#8221; No one seems to know many such people, but
most people say they know at least one. These
people injure everything that pleases them, and that
they admire. If they admire a baby it will get ill and
very likely die; if they admire a mule it will probably
go lame; if they admire a tree it will wither; if they
admire a cup it will break. There does not seem to
be necessarily any wish to do harm, the mere taking
pleasure in the thing causes the disaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Persons with the evil eye are quite impossible to
distinguish, so the Persians are afraid of all strangers
lest they should have it. This is why you must
not admire a baby, and Persian mothers cover up
their young babies completely in the street for fear a
casual passer-by should admire them and should
prove to have the evil eye.</p>

<p>The men carry iron in their pockets as a protection,
and a magnet is considered specially powerful in this
way. A more common form of iron to carry is an
iron chain, which is useful for driving mules and
donkeys and beating off savage dogs.</p>

<p>The women sometimes wear charms to make their
husbands love them. One poor thing gave me hers&mdash;two
large beads: they had not proved of much use, for
her husband beat her and treated her very badly.</p>

<p>Another charm is a tiny bag of the scented earth of
Kerbela, where Muhammad&#8217;s grandson Husain was
killed, and if rubbed on the eyelids it is said to cause
the eyes to shine brightly.</p>

<p>The beads of the Muhammadan rosaries are often
made of this Kerbela earth. Every Muhammadan has
his rosary&mdash;many of them have quite a collection, for
pilgrims to Kerbela bring back rosaries for all their friends.</p>

<p>These rosaries are never used for counting prayers,
but occasionally for counting the attributes of God or
invocations. But the main use is a very different
one. They are the Persian&#8217;s ordinary means of trying
to find out God&#8217;s will. They are used both in serious
and in frivolous matters; no Persian will settle anything
without &#8220;taking the beads.&#8221; He takes the beads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
before making a business appointment, but he takes
them again to see whether he shall keep it or not.
He takes the beads to see what doctor he is to send for,
and again to see if he shall follow his instructions. He
takes the beads to see if it is a good day to buy a new
coat, and again to see if it is a good day to put it on.
You often see a pious Muhammadan fingering the beads
under her <i>ch&#257;dar</i> before she answers your questions.</p>

<p>The rosaries are made of a large number of small
beads all alike, and three only, which are different and
are called &#8220;<i>Sheikhs</i>,&#8221; placed in different parts of the
string. To take the beads a Muhammadan turns towards
Mecca and says an Arabic collect. Then he
divides the beads without looking, and tells them
off two by two, saying over and over, as he does so,
&#8220;<i>Subh&#257;nu&#8217;ll&#257;h</i>&#8221; (God is glorious) &#8220;<i>Alhamdu&#8217;li&#8217;ll&#257;h</i>&#8221;
(Praise be to God), &#8220;<i>Va&#8217;ll&#257;h</i>&#8221; (and He is the God),
passing two beads for each word until he comes to a
<i>Sheikh</i>, when he stops. If there are two beads for the last
word, the answer is much more emphatic than if there is
only an odd one. If the last word is &#8220;<i>Subh&#257;nu&#8217;ll&#257;h</i>&#8221;
the answer is favourable, &#8220;<i>Alhamdu&#8217;li&#8217;ll&#257;h</i>&#8221; is doubtful
and &#8220;<i>Va&#8217;ll&#257;h</i>&#8221; is unfavourable. If the answer is doubtful
a Persian generally follows his own inclinations.</p>

<p>If the answer is not what the questioner likes, the
beads may be taken again in the mosque, and the
answer in the mosque take precedence of that in the
house. If, however, the answer is still the same, there
is a third method. For a small fee a mulla will do the
same sort of thing with the Quran, and the text
selected overrules the two previous answers.</p>

<p>A Persian lady sent for an English missionary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
extract an aching tooth. The missionary found her in
great pain, but she said she could not have the tooth
out as the beads were against it, but she had sent to the
mosque and was hoping for a favourable answer from
there. However, all methods gave an unfavourable
answer, so she put off the extraction to another day.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be much better for me to have it out,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;but it is not God&#8217;s Will.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Wise Men from the East looked for God&#8217;s
guidance among the stars, and there God sent them a
message. And here and there where a Muhammadan
earnestly seeks God&#8217;s guidance, because he is trying to
really live as God&#8217;s servant, who shall say that he does
not receive it where he has been taught to look for it.</p>

<p>But taken as a system, how trivial, how childish,
how irreverent it all is. They use God&#8217;s name, but
they take His name in vain. They profess to seek
God&#8217;s will, and profess to receive an answer from Him,
and often try the next moment to set it aside and force
or coax an opposite answer out of Him.</p>

<p>The Muhammadans think that through their beads
they can <i>use</i> God for settling the every-day matters of
this world in a lucky way, while they are disobeying
Him in the greater matter of godly living.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>PERSIAN SCHOOLS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> many things are topsy-turvy in Persia, but
perhaps reading is as topsy-turvy as anything. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
is not only that the lines, and indeed the whole book,
begin at the wrong end, but the lessons begin at the
wrong end too.</p>

<p>An English boy learns to read his own language
first, and does not always go on to a foreign language.
A Persian boy learns to read a foreign language first,
and does not always go on to his own language.</p>

<p>When a little Persian boy goes to school he is given
a big Arabic book, with a great many long words in it,
and he is not taught how the words are spelt, but is
told what they are, and made to repeat them from
memory, pointing to each word in the book as he says
it, and gradually he gets some idea of which word is
which.</p>

<p>The boys sit on the floor round the room, all reading
at the top of their voices at the same time in different
parts of the book. They read in a monotonous sing-song
voice, swaying their bodies in time to the sound.</p>

<p>The master sits and listens through the din to one
and another correcting mistakes here and there, and
calling up any boy who seems perfect in his lesson to
learn the next bit, and then return to his seat and read
it over and over till he knows it too.</p>

<p>The book is the Quran, which the Muhammadans
think was dictated by God to Muhammad through the
Archangel Gabriel. It would not be surprising if the
Persians, being Muhammadans, wished all their boys
to learn what they believe to be God&#8217;s Word; but the
book is written in Arabic, which Persian boys do not
understand, and even the letters are not quite the same
as in Persian; so when the little pupil reaches the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the book he can read the Quran with the proper
intonation, but he can read nothing else, and he cannot
understand the Quran.</p>

<p>The Muhammadans, however, think that reading the
Quran, quite apart from understanding it, is a very
good action, so the little Persian boys work away at
it, and they do not think it hard lines because they
know all the men, and big boys began in the same way,
so it seems the natural thing to do. And perhaps it is
a little consolation to know that when they reach
certain points they will be given sweets. One little
boy, who was asked how far he had got in the Quran,
said that he had just got to his first sweets.</p>

<p>Having finished the Quran our little Persian boy
goes on to Persian books. These, too, he studies
in much the same way as he did the Quran, but it
is more useful, because now he understands what he
reads. After plodding through the Quran it is a
pleasant change for little Ghul&#257;m Husain to turn
to the War between the Cats and Mice, the Hundred
Fables, or Stories of Husain and Hasan (Muhammad&#8217;s
two grandsons). Later on he reads the poems of H&#257;fiz
and Sa&#8217;adi, and other great Persian poets, for there is
a great deal of beautiful poetry in Persian.</p>

<p>There is no convenient desk or table for Ghul&#257;m
Husain to write on. He sits on the floor and holds the
paper in his hand or on his knee. His pen is a bit of
fine cane, cut like a quill, but with a slanting end. As
he holds it the handle points directly to the right and
it is the horizontal lines which he must make broad,
while the up and down strokes must both be fine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A PERSIAN SCHOOL</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Ghul&#257;m Husain never spills his ink. Each boy has
his own inkpot, which contains a tangled piece of silk
soaked in ink. It dries up between the lessons, so
when Ghul&#257;m Husain wants to write he moistens it
with water so that the silk is thoroughly wet, but there
is no water lying in the inkpot. In among this wet
silk he dips his pen.</p>

<p>If you look into Ghul&#257;m Husain&#8217;s pen-box you will
find pens cut to various breadths for large or small
writing, a penknife, and a little slab to rest the pen-point
on for the final cut; an inkpot, and a tiny brass
ladle for adding water.</p>

<p>Many an English boy finds it tiresome to have to
dot his i&#8217;s, but little Ghul&#257;m Husain has to dot almost
every letter, some above the line and some below,
some with one dot, some with two, and some with
three. These dots are not round, but square, and the
height of the letters is measured by the size of the
dots. This letter must be one dot high, that letter
two dots high, another three, and yet another five
dots high. The size of the dot itself depends on the
breadth of the pen.</p>

<p>As he learns to write better he will run his letters
into curious combinations, and group his dots
picturesquely in parts of the word to which they do
not belong, or leave them out altogether, until at
last, when he can write a really beautiful hand,
the schoolmaster himself will not be able to read
the letter without careful study, and may even have
to guess at the meaning of particularly well-written
passages.</p>

<p>One great beauty of a Persian letter is the way each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
line runs up at the end, making a pile of words, syllables,
and even single letters, something in this style:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Persians do not apparently think much of
their own system of education, for they are always
laughing at their schoolmasters.</p>

<p>They have a story of a <i>ch&#257;rv&#257;d&#257;r</i>, or muleteer, one
of whose mules strayed one day into a school. It was
quickly driven out, and the muleteer claimed damages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
from the schoolmaster to the extent of half the value
of the mule. The schoolmaster indignantly asked on
what he based his claim. The muleteer turned to the
crowd which had gathered to listen to the argument.
&#8220;My beast,&#8221; said he, &#8220;went into his school a mule
and it has come out a donkey.&#8221; You see a donkey
counts half a mule in caravan travelling, just as a child
counts half a person in train travelling.</p>

<p>The punishments are as topsy-turvy as the lessons.
When a boy is caned he lies on his back and holds out
his feet instead of his hands. Sometimes his feet are
held in a kind of stocks while he is caned across the
soles. They call it &#8220;eating sticks&#8221; or &#8220;eating wood&#8221;&mdash;the
words are the same.</p>

<p>Some missionaries were picnicking one day in an
orchard in a hill village, and the village children
gathered round to watch the foreigners&#8217; strange ways.
&#8220;Do you often come and eat plums here?&#8221; one of the
ladies asked; and she was greatly bewildered by the
curious tastes of Persian boys, when the owner of the
orchard answered for them, that the boys who came
into his orchard ate not the plums but the wood.</p>

<p>This beating on the soles of the feet is a common
punishment for every one, from the slave and the schoolboy
to the criminal and the political offender. With
schoolboys it is of course not very severe, but in more
serious cases it may be very severe indeed, even resulting
in death. The culprit in these cases is ordered
not so many blows but so many sticks, <i>i.e.</i> he is to be
beaten till so many sticks have been broken. A
hundred sticks is not an uncommon punishment. If
the culprit is rich enough he may bribe the <i>farr&#257;shes</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
strike the stocks when possible and so break the
sticks quickly, and not over his feet; but a poor man
has to take his punishment.</p>

<p>There is no compulsory education in Persia and very
little free education. There was one man who tried
to atone for sins, which he made no pretence of giving
up, by founding a large free school in one Persian
town, but it is not a common form of benevolence.
So it is only those who can spare a little money who
send their boys to school, and a great many never get
beyond a very early stage of reading and writing.</p>

<p>As for the girls very few parents care to waste their
money over their girls&#8217; education. A certain number
are taught to read the Quran, a less number go on
to reading such books as they have studied, but very
few can read at sight, and writing is even rarer. Still
in the matter of the education of girls Persia is in
advance of other Muhammadan countries.</p>

<p>In these days of general education it is difficult
for us to realise in this country how hard it is for the
missionaries to teach the gospel truths to the Persians.
There is so much to be taught and there are so many
to be taught, and when it has to be done orally to
people whose intelligence and memory have never been
developed by study of any kind, whose minds and
brains have never grown up properly, and who forget
so easily, it means an amount of work that would
take up all the time and strength of far more missionaries
than are now in the field.</p>

<p>Many of the converts cannot come regularly for
oral teaching, and they are liable at any time to move
out of the missionaries&#8217; reach, so the missionaries try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to teach all the converts and their children to read their
Bibles at any rate, so that they can get teaching direct
from God&#8217;s Word themselves.</p>

<p>Besides the Persian schools there are now several
Christian schools in Persia, but we will talk about
those in the next chapter. Since they were started
there has been an attempt in some of the big towns
to introduce an improved system of teaching, and
Persian reading-books are now printed with <i>ba-bi-bu</i>,
<i>pa-pi-pu</i>, etc. etc.; but this is the exceptional method
of teaching, and not the rule in Persia, and I doubt
if any orthodox schoolmaster would care to teach
Persian before he taught the Arabic Quran.</p>

<p>The Parsees have a very good school in Yezd, largely
supported by the Parsees in Bombay, but this is only
for Parsee boys.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are two branches of mission-work in Persia
that bring the missionaries into close touch with
Persian children: one is the hospital, the other is the
school. You will hear about the medical work
presently; in this chapter we will look at the school
work.</p>

<p>There are Europeans in Persia, wanting English-speaking
servants and employés; there are rich
Persians wanting secretaries who can write French and
English; there are business firms trading with England
and India who want English-speaking clerks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
correspondents; so naturally many Persians want
their sons to learn English; and who should teach it
better than the Englishman?</p>

<p>But this is not all they want. As they get to know
the Christians they see that there is something in
English ways and English character that the Persian
lacks. And they bring their boys to the missionary,
and ask him not merely to teach them English, not
merely to teach them book-learning of any sort, but
to teach them to be good boys.</p>

<p>They do not so often ask for a girls&#8217; school, for they
do not think a girl needs any book education as a
rule, and only a few of the Persian women can even
read. Yet in some of the Mission-stations girls&#8217;
schools have been started with great success, and year
by year the demand for them is growing.</p>

<p>English is less taught in these schools, but some of the
girls learn it, especially those most closely connected
with the mission. The girls, of course, have to give
a good deal of time to sewing and embroidery, which
are more necessary for them than foreign languages.</p>

<p>But in all the Mission-stations sooner or later,
generally sooner, a boys&#8217; school is started, and these
schools vary very much according to the needs of the
different towns.</p>

<p>In one school Armenians and Muhammadans work
side by side, in another we find Muhammadans and
Parsees, while a third contains all three.</p>

<p>In one school only English is taught, in another
advanced Persian and Arabic are added. In yet
another, everything is taught from the Persian alphabet
onwards.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>One missionary works alone in his own house,
another has a full staff of Armenian and Persian
teachers and monitors, and a well-built convenient
school.</p>

<p>But whatever the race of the boys, whatever the
subjects taught, whatever the organisation, there are
difficulties to be faced.</p>

<p>It is difficult to get teachers; sometimes none
can be got on the spot, and they have to be fetched
from some other town, perhaps several weeks&#8217; journey
away. Sometimes the missionary has to be the only
teacher till he can train some of his own boys to be
first monitors and then masters in the school.</p>

<p>Then there is the school itself. Sometimes the
small beginnings of a school are started in the
missionary&#8217;s own dining-room; sometimes he is able
to spare a room entirely for school purposes. In one
case this was supplemented by a rough tent or shed
made of matting in the compound. But as the school
grows, separate buildings have to be found or
built.</p>

<p>Books are another difficulty. All books for teaching
English have to be got from abroad, and many are not
suitable. Readers which are very suitable for the
size of boy who reads them in England or India, are
not suitable for the young men who often use them
in Persia. If you give an educated young man, well
read in the finest Persian poetry, the childish stories
and rhymes in many of the readers, he thinks English
books are very, very foolish, and his opinion of English
intelligence in both literary and religious matters falls
very low.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>All these things need money. The boys generally
pay a very small fee and buy their own books, but the
fees do not go far towards paying for the schools
and the teachers&#8217; salaries, and the getting together of
the necessary money is another difficulty.</p>

<p>The pupils themselves present three great difficulties.
In our country boys under fourteen generally go to
different schools from boys over fourteen, and those
who wish to continue their education after seventeen or
eighteen leave school and go to college, or attend special
lectures. But in Persia the missionary is asked to
take them all together in one school, even middle-aged
men wishing to become pupils. But it is quite impossible
to make a satisfactory school of boys and men
together. It is sometimes possible, especially in the
larger schools, to arrange separately for the men, but
generally an age limit has to be set.</p>

<p>The second difficulty arises from the number of boys
who want to learn English and who are never likely to
have any use for it. They have an idea that it is so
new and uncommon that any one who knows it is bound
to get work at a good salary, and so they want to
waste their time over it when they ought to be learning
the subjects they will really need for their work. It
takes some time and trouble to sort these boys out
from those who are really likely to need English.
The third difficulty is not peculiar to Persia, though it
presents some peculiarities there. It is the problem
of managing the boys.</p>

<p>Boys in England, I am sorry to say, sometimes tell
lies, but in Persia it would be more correct to say that
they sometimes tell the truth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Then again the boys are of different ranks; some
of them come with their servants, and a certain amount
of tact has to be used to get them to accept the ordinary
rules of discipline. But in a school where everybody
comes to learn most of these difficulties can be
overcome.</p>

<p>Persian boys want knowing, like all boys, but when
one tries to do one&#8217;s best for them one finds them
thoroughly lovable and possessed of a large number
of exceedingly good points.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <i>Mull&#257;s</i>, or Muhammadan clergy, see
in the schools the greatest danger to their religion, and
they oppose them strongly. They know that such
close contact with Christians must open the boys&#8217;
eyes to some extent to the contrast between Muhammadanism
and Christianity, and they know Muhammadanism
cannot stand such a comparison.</p>

<p>Many Muhammadans, who believe that Muhammadanism
is a true religion given to them by God through
Muhammad, still see that Christianity is the better
religion, and Muhammadans have told me that God had
given us a better religion than He had given them.</p>

<p>So the <i>Mull&#257;s</i> try to persuade or frighten the
fathers into not sending their boys to the Mission-school,
they try to frighten the boys out of going, and
they try to get the governors to close the schools. But
it is God&#8217;s work, and He does not allow them to stop
it for long.</p>

<p>The boys themselves show the greatest interest in
whatever they are told about the Bible, and naturally
in one way or another Bible reading is always a
prominent feature of every class of Mission-school.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Sometimes there is a regular lesson on the Bible as
one of the school subjects, but in other places there
are no Bible lessons, but only prayers and Bible-reading,
with very simple explanations. But however this
may be, the gospel story of Christ Jesus, which is known
by name to every Muhammadan, but by more than
name to very, very few, is always of absorbing interest,
and is not likely to be forgotten.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>WORK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;To</span> the house of &#8216;Ali Akbar the pea-roaster,&#8221; I said to
my servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two &#8216;Ali Akbars pea-roasters,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;one is alive, and one dead; which do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>It proved to be the widow who had sent for me, and
we were soon great friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you go to school?&#8221; I asked Husain, a
merry little boy of eight.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am an apprentice-baker,&#8221; he said with an
evident sense of importance; he felt he was a wage-earner&mdash;a
halfpenny a day, I think was the amount, but
where a labourer often only earns fivepence a day, even
a halfpenny a day counts for something in the family.</p>

<p>Seven years old seems to be a very common age for
apprenticing boys in Persia. A boy of that age can
make himself useful and gradually learn his trade, and
if his master and his fellow-apprentices are kind he
may be very happy, like my little baker. He probably
fetched and carried, brought sticks for heating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
oven, laid out the long thin flat loaves in rows as they
were handed to him from the oven, and later carried
them in a tray on his head, or hanging over his shoulder,
to some of the customers.</p>

<p>Probably our Lord Jesus Christ Himself started
work in the carpenter&#8217;s shop at Nazareth as soon as
He could be of any use. He would fetch and carry
tools, sort out the nails, help to clear away the
shavings, and later He would learn to hammer nails, to
saw and plane, just as the little Persian apprentices
do to-day, and He would thoroughly enjoy helping
Joseph in the workshop and Mary in the house.</p>

<p>There was a little &#8220;apprentice-carpenter&#8221; who
looked such a baby he can hardly have been as old as
seven. He used to run back to the shop for tools or
nails, and hold the hammer, and he even succeeded
in pulling some nails out of a packing-case. But his
master was not always kind to him, and sometimes beat
him, and he did not seem as happy as the baker boy.</p>

<p>Servants will often bring their little boys to the
house to help them in their work, and gradually fit
themselves for service. When they begin to be really
useful the master generally gives them a small wage.
A servant who has no boy of his own will often bring
a nephew or a cousin.</p>

<p>In every trade you find them, little boys whose
business it is to lighten their elders&#8217; work a little in
any way they can, for the Persians are not over fond of
hard work.</p>

<p>You find them too in the houses of poor people, who
cannot afford to keep a regular servant, but pay a few
coppers or a meal to a little boy to come in and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
himself useful, sweeping the floor and watering it in
hot weather, preparing the <i>qali&#257;n</i>, or hookah, running
errands, chopping firewood, and a hundred other
things. It is a system that works very well when it is
worked with kindness and consideration, but it is a
terrible system when it is abused.</p>

<p>In the Persian carpet trade we see this. In the
villages the whole family works at one carpet, and
as the children grow old enough they are taught and
made to join in the work. There need be no cruelty
in this, and often the little things are only too proud
and happy to do as their elders do, and join in the
family task. But unhappily even in the family there
are many cases of cruel overwork and ill-treatment.</p>

<p>But for the horrors of child labour in the carpet trade
we must turn to the factories of Kirman.</p>

<p>These factories are filled with children from four
years old upward, underfed, overworked, living a
loveless, joyless, hopeless life. The factories are built
without windows lest the children&#8217;s attention should
be distracted, and the bad air, want of food, and the
constantly keeping in one position produce rickets
and deformity in nearly all. Of thirty-eight children
examined in one factory thirty-six were deformed.</p>

<p>One of the Governors of Kirman forbade the employment
of children under twelve in the factories,
but the order did not last beyond his governorship.
The same Governor gave the order still in force, which
forbids the employment of children before dawn or
after sunset, thus reducing their working hours to an
average of twelve hours a day. A recent Governor
added to this an order limiting the Friday work to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
about two and a half hours, &#8220;from sunrise to full
sunshine,&#8221; so now the children share in part the general
Friday holiday of Muhammadanism.</p>

<p>One of our medical missionaries was called to attend
the wife of the owner of one of these factories, and
consented to do so on condition he made windows in
his factory to allow the children air and light. He
objected at first, saying that it would prevent their
working, but finally consented, and admitted afterwards
that the children did more work with the
windows than they had done without them.</p>

<p>The factory owners are glad to get the children, for
they say children work better than grown-up people
at carpet-making, and of course they expect less wages.
But how can the parents allow their children to live
this cruel life? You will find the answer in the
Persian saying that &#8220;of every three persons in Kirman,
four smoke opium.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man who takes opium regularly becomes a
wreck; first his digestion is ruined, then his heart gets
weak and he get bronchitis and other chest troubles,
and he become unreliable physically and morally; he
is untruthful and deceitful, and when he is once well
under the power of the habit, he goes almost mad if
he cannot get his opium at the usual time, and would
sell his soul for it, and does sell his children. Over
and over again comes the terrible story, the father and
mother smoke opium; the little deformed child toils
through the long days to earn the money that buys it.</p>

<p>In the villages the children begin almost as soon as
they can run about to take out the sheep and goats, not
in green fields, for there are none, but among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
scattered plants on the mountain-side or under the
village trees.</p>

<p>Only the boys are allowed to take the flocks out on
the hills at any distance from the village, and on
mountains where there are thought to be wolves, even
the boys are forbidden to go without a man.</p>

<p>But in and around the villages boys and girls alike
turn out. Often they carry a long pole, generally more
than twice as long as themselves. This pole serves at
times as a fence to keep the flock from wandering into
crops as they pass them on their way, or as they graze
on the stubble of the neighbouring crops which have
been already gathered in. The stubble itself is not
much, but there are more weeds there because the
ground has been watered. But neither on the hills
nor in the fields can they find much pasture in the heat
of summer, so the little shepherds and shepherdesses
take their flocks under the trees and beat the leaves
down with their poles for the animals to eat. When
the lower leaves are finished they climb, boys and
girls alike, into the trees, often to considerable heights,
and beat the higher branches. The leaves that are
not eaten are dried and kept for the winter as we keep
hay. It is an awkward thing for a child to climb
trees encumbered with a long pole, and in the districts
where they do this there are often accidents. One
little boy of eight or nine was brought to the Yezd
hospital with a bad compound fracture of his skull
through falling out of a tree while tending the sheep.
He got nearly well, and then his mother took him home,
so I do not know whether he fully recovered or not.</p>

<p>Among the richer classes the children sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
undertake nominal work at a very early age, but not
actual work. One boy of about sixteen in our school
held a position in the Persian army corresponding to
that of Colonel, and there was said to be a Field-Marshal
of twelve in the army.</p>

<p>Merchants consider it good training for their sons
to do a little business on their own account, and some
of our schoolboys imported goods from Bombay or
elsewhere while they were still at school, and disposed
of them at a profit.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>CHILD WIVES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Persian girls stay at home longer than the little
apprentices, but not so long as the richer schoolboys.</p>

<p>The usual age for a Muhammadan girl to marry is
thirteen or fourteen, but in many places they marry
as early as eight or nine.</p>

<p>This perhaps explains why the girl is given no voice in
the choice of a husband, and all is left to the parents.</p>

<p>It perhaps partly explains too why Muhammadans
are allowed to beat their wives, though they will tell
you, as a proof of their prophet&#8217;s kindness to women,
that he forbade them to do it with a chain. A little girl
who has not had time to grow up and learn to behave
herself, will often no doubt be difficult to control.</p>

<p>The young wife of a shoemaker one day lost her
temper because her husband said he could not afford
to buy her something she wanted. She proceeded to
break all the ornaments in the house and to tear her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
best <i>ch&#257;dar</i> to rags. Her husband, who was a Christian,
went to the English missionary to ask whether it would
be allowable under the circumstances to beat her.</p>

<p>Another girl refused to cook her husband any food
when he came home from his work, and would not
even speak to him. She admitted that he was very
kind to her, and that she liked him better than her
own brothers, but still continued to sulk in this way.
Her own relations said a good beating was what she
wanted, but her husband had scruples about wife-beating,
and would not do anything. But not many
Persian husbands are so forbearing.</p>

<p>Another necessary result of these early marriages
is the custom of living with the husband&#8217;s parents.
A girl of even fourteen is not fit to be given sole charge
of a house. So the bridegroom takes his bride home
to his father&#8217;s house, and puts her under the charge of
her mother-in-law. When, however, the mother-in-law
becomes a widow, she has to take a secondary place,
if her daughter-in-law is at all of an age to manage her
own affairs. Then the old lady often prefers to leave
her son&#8217;s house, and to go and live with a married
daughter, and the men are generally very good in
taking in their mothers-in-law.</p>

<p>Poor little girl wives! They are taken away from
home before they are grown up, and although they are
now married women they cannot help behaving as
children. There was one young wife of a Government
official who received her visitors with the utmost
dignity and propriety, and then could not resist the
temptation to pinch the old black woman who was
handing the tea and make her jump.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>And they hardly know what to do with their babies.
They love to nurse them and play with them, but they get
very tired of them and are often glad to hand them over to
the grandmother. I went to condole with one girl on the
death of her dear little baby, and she said, &#8220;It was just
as well it died before the winter. It would have been
such cold work getting up in the night to look after it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even when the children grow older their mothers,
grown-up children themselves, do not know how to
manage them. What do you think of mothers who
lose their tempers with their children, and fly at them
and bite them? And they are not ashamed of it, and
their neighbours do not seem surprised or horrified.
One woman bit her little boy&#8217;s hand, till it bled badly.
He was about seven, and had cried to have his best
coat on when he went to see the missionary. Another
woman bit the cheek of a poor little consumptive girl
of eight or nine, so that there was a great bruise, and the
skin was broken. She told a neighbour, with a laugh, that
she had got angry with the child because she was tiresome
about taking her medicine, which was very nasty.</p>

<p>There is no command in the Quran that girls should
be married so young, but the mothers declare that it
was the command of Muhammad, and certainly he
himself set the example by marrying a girl of nine. So
when a mother thinks her girl is getting old enough
to marry she begins to look out for a suitable husband,
and talks things over with the mother or sister of any
man she thinks likely. The man&#8217;s mother is allowed
to see the girl, but not the man himself, so you see even
the men cannot choose their own wives. Then the
money matters are arranged. It is settled how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the girl&#8217;s father will give her, and how much her
husband will settle on her, and there is often a great
deal of haggling over this.</p>

<p>If a girl has a cousin who is the son of her father&#8217;s
brother, he is considered the most appropriate husband
for her, and it is considered an act of merit for him to
marry her.</p>

<p>If a girl has a large dowry she can generally get a
good husband as husbands go out there. If she is
poor she has more difficulty, but a capable, industrious
girl may do fairly well. But a penniless girl with
nothing to recommend her fares badly indeed. When
her mother fails to get any husband who is at all desirable
instead of letting her girl remain single, she
marries her to a madman or a drunkard or a deformed
man, or someone utterly undesirable.</p>

<p>The engagement is celebrated by a formal sweet-eating
to which the friends on both sides are invited.</p>

<p>The bride and her family prepare her trousseau, and
she also has to make a complete suit of clothes for the
bridegroom. In one town now it is customary for every
well-to-do bride to have one European dress in her trousseau,
and for her father to give her a table and chairs.</p>

<p>The wedding itself is a great affair, lasting a week,
if the bride&#8217;s father can afford it, but only a day or
part of a day in the case of poor people. The little
bride in her finest clothes, of which she is very proud,
looks very disconsolate and cries a great deal. No
doubt the tears are sometimes genuine enough, for the
child is leaving her home and going to people she knows
little of, but even if she feels inclined to laugh and smile
she must not do anything so improper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>After the wedding she must not leave her husband&#8217;s
house for a year, but she may receive visitors.</p>

<p>As we have seen the marriage and wedding are
arranged by the women, but generally the bridegroom
has more say in the matter than one young man I
knew. He had been engaged for some time, and on
going home from work one evening found his wedding
prepared without his having been consulted, and had
to be married then and there. He was fond of children,
and quickly won the heart of his little wife, who cried
when he had to go back to his work.</p>

<p>We do sometimes find happy family parties in
Persia, the husbands treating their wives with consideration,
and the wives being very fond of their
husbands. One old lady told me, with tears in her eyes,
how good her husband always was to her, and how he
always got up and made a cup of tea for her in the
morning if she was not well. But this is the exception
and not the rule. There does not generally seem to be
any great affection between husband and wife. The
husband expects implicit obedience from his wife, and
is prepared to enforce it. On the other hand she has
certain privileges. She generally has the best courtyard
in the house, to which no men are admitted but
near relations, and the smaller courtyard is given up
to her husband to receive his guests in.</p>

<p>Except in the highest classes Persian women go about
a good deal, but always have to wear a veil in the street
or draw the <i>ch&#257;dar</i> over their faces.</p>

<p>The man is absolute master in his own house, and unless
his wife has powerful relations he may do what he likes
to her and her children, and no one will take any notice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>I knew one woman whose husband treated her like a
slave. He forced her not only to do all the work of
the house, but the work of the stable too, for he was
well enough off to keep a horse. He killed one child
in her arms, and twice stole another away from her,
sending it once to a town a week&#8217;s journey off, and once
to another part of the town. Finally he divorced her,
without giving any reason, and left her ill and destitute.
And she had at no time any redress.</p>

<p>Certainly Muhammadanism does not tend to make
good husbands, nor perhaps good wives either. The
Persians are many of them kindly people, however, and
treat their wives better than Muhammad taught them
to do. Otherwise the lot of women in Persia would be
harder than it is. One great evil they are spared, for
the widows are not despised and ill-treated as the
Hindu widows are, but are allowed to marry again, and
generally do so if they are of a suitable age.</p>

<p>Still the condition of girls in Persia is not a happy
one, and I think that all of you who have Christian
mothers, and know what the love of such a mother can
be, will have something to pray about, when you think
of mothers and their children in Persia.</p>

<small>SICK CHILDREN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Measles,</span> scarlet fever, whooping cough, mumps,
chickenpox, Persian children have them all. Typhoid
fever, diphtheria, rheumatic fever are all common.
But almost the commonest illness of all is smallpox.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>A woman brought a child into the dispensary waiting-room
one day covered with a smallpox rash. The
doctor, new to the country, ordered her out, condemning
her reckless disregard for infection. &#8220;Is
there anyone who has not had smallpox?&#8221; she asked,
looking round at the thirty or forty other people
in the room. As she expected, all had had it, and she
came in.</p>

<p>It is considered a children&#8217;s illness, because people
hardly ever grow up without having had it. In fact,
their parents take care they shall not, for they are so
afraid they will take it badly at an awkward time that
they choose a convenient time, and either put the child
with a person who has smallpox mildly, or, oftener,
inoculate him with it, just as we inoculate our babies
with vaccine.</p>

<p>My cook asked me one day, with tears, to go and
see his baby; they had given it smallpox to get it
over, and it had taken it badly. I am glad to say it
recovered. He had not thought it necessary to make
any difference in his cooking for us, while he was
spending his nights with a baby with smallpox.
Another missionary&#8217;s cook brought his little boy with
smallpox to the kitchen because it was more cheerful
for him than being at home; he could lie and watch his
father cooking.</p>

<p>So the Persians do not take much trouble to prevent
their children from getting ill. How do they care for
them when they are ill?</p>

<p>First of all they start doctoring them themselves,
except in smallpox, when they say it is dangerous to give
any medicine. For other illnesses they give plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
medicine, not in little teaspoonfuls, but in nice big
bowlfuls, and the nastier it is the more good they think
it will do. On the whole Persian children are exceedingly
good about taking their medicine, but
whether they are or not they have to take it. One
way of giving it to naughty children is to pour it
through their noses from a little tin cup with a long
narrow spout.</p>

<p>If the child gets no better the doctor is consulted;
very often two or three doctors are called in, and sometimes
the parents follow the doctor&#8217;s advice, but very
often they do not. It depends partly on the beads,
and a good deal on how much they have paid. If they
pay much they generally make the patient take all
the medicine for fear their money should be wasted.
If the doctor seems unable to cure the patient a reader
is called in, sometimes a man, sometimes a woman, who
reads the Quran over the patient in the hope that it
may effect a cure where medical treatment has failed.</p>

<p>In the case of a long, tiresome illness, or when they
despair of recovery, it is not uncommon for the patient&#8217;s
friends to hasten the end by giving a dose of poison.</p>

<p>One girl, who had very little the matter with her, but
was always making a fuss over her ailments, gave her
family a great deal of trouble with her fancies. They
found her recovery was likely to be slow, and although
she was going on well they one day told the doctor that
&#8220;they had <i>given her sherbet</i> and she had died.&#8221;</p>

<p>I myself was several times asked to give poison in
the form of medicine, and I think they were rather
surprised when I told them how Christians regard
such a thing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>When the medical missionary starts work he may
be puzzled by the very common request that he will
give the second medicine first. It appears that the
people think, with how much truth I cannot say, that
their doctors give first a medicine to make the patient
worse and then one to make him better.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was what the devoted old grandmother
was thinking of, who had brought her poor little granddaughter
in from a village many miles away, very, very
ill with rheumatic fever. She called in the English
doctor, and got her medicine from the dispensary, but
when the doctor called next day, she said she had not
given the child any, because she remembered she had
never asked if it would do her good and so she was
afraid to try it.</p>

<p>It must surely have been in the minds of the friends
of one patient who came to the missionary, and said
their friend was worse every time she took her medicine,
and they wanted some more, it was doing her so much
good.</p>

<p>When you are very ill, Mother keeps you very quiet
and does not let you see visitors, but when a little
Persian is very ill all the neighbours crowd in to see him,
and the more ill he is the more people come in. And
they do not tread on tiptoe and talk in a whisper, they
all talk quite loud out and smoke <i>qali&#257;ns</i> and drink
tea, and make noise enough to give anyone in good
health a headache, much more a sick child.</p>

<p>One day I was called in to see a child who was
dangerously ill. Instead of showing me into her room,
the mother, together with a variety of aunts, sisters,
and other relations, escorted me to their receiving-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
I asked for the sick child, and was told I should
see her after tea, which meant at least half an hour&#8217;s
delay. As the account they had given of her sounded
very bad, I said I could not wait, that it was not our
custom to think of tea-drinking and entertainment
when our patients were perhaps dying. With great
difficulty I managed to persuade them to take me to
the poor little girl, whom they had left alone while they
all came to have tea and sweets with me. She was, as
they had said, very ill, her recovery was very doubtful,
yet as soon as we left the room, and had sent for the
medicine, they were all eager to entertain me, and I do
not think anyone would have stayed with the child if I
had not insisted, and they were all as gay and lively as if
they had had no one dangerously ill in the next room.</p>

<p>The Persians are very hospitable and like to put their
best before a visitor, and they consider it very necessary
to provide something nice for the doctor. Some
Persian doctors send word beforehand what refreshments
they would like got ready.</p>

<p>Sometimes this deters the very poor from calling
in even the mission doctor, who, they know, would
treat them free. They cannot even provide tea and
sugar. It was a great relief to more than one poor
person, when it was discovered that the mission ladies
were fond of boiled turnips, for a plate of turnips was
within the reach of the poorest, costing only about a
halfpenny. The news spread, and several sick people
were able at once to have a doctor.</p>

<p>But it is in surgery that one sees the Persian doctor
at his worst.</p>

<p>Here comes little Husain with his head plastered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
up with mud; on removing the mud we find a broken
skull and a large wound in a foul condition. Next
comes little Sak&#299;neh with both hands burnt; the
burns are smeared with sticky white of egg covered
over with leaves; it will take days of proper dressing
to get the wounds clean. But she is not so badly off
as Rub&#257;beh, whose burn has been dressed with camphorated
oil, and is so inflamed that she screams and
cries the whole time.</p>

<p>A more fortunate child was the little girl who was
scalded nearly all over, but not deeply, and who looked
like a little nigger with the <i>ink</i> they had put on. She
got well very quickly. It is like Indian ink, and seems
to be the best of the remedies the Persians use for burns.</p>

<p>With broken bones the Persian doctors are not very
successful either. Little Hasan, aged four, fell and
broke both arms. The Persian doctor as usual tied
them up with splints that were too small to be any real
use, but he tried to make up for that by tying the
bandages very tight, and poor little Hasan had both
arms partly destroyed. How proud he was when,
after some weeks at the C.M.S. hospital, he was able
to carry an English doll clasped to his heart with the
two poor bandaged stumps.</p>

<p>There was some truth in what one doctor said, that
more than half the cases that came into the hospital had
come there in consequence of the Persian doctors&#8217; treatment.
The remedy is generally worse than the disease.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, and I have met Persian doctors,
who not only had real knowledge of medical treatment,
but had some of the true doctor&#8217;s spirit of pity and
self-sacrifice. Especially I would mention the brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Persian doctor who stayed at his post in Shiraz in the
cholera epidemic of 1904, and fought that terrible
disease instead of yielding to the panic that had seized
his fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that there is a great and
crying need for dispensaries and hospitals in Persia.
So in the north the American Presbyterians, and in the
south the Church Missionary Society, have founded
them in a number of towns.</p>

<p>As a rule a dispensary is started first, to which out-patients
can come to get medicines and have their hurts
attended to. Later a hospital is opened. Generally
the first hospital is a very poor affair, but as the work
grows money is collected, and nice, clean, convenient
hospitals are built and furnished. Armenian and
Persian boys and girls are trained as nurses and
assistants, the boys for the men&#8217;s hospital, the girls
for the women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Here Hasan and &#8216;Ali, F&#257;timeh and Rub&#257;beh, and a
great many other little Persian children are made as
comfortable as their illness allows, and are kept clean
and happy in comfortable beds, and well fed and cared
for.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_090.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A MISSION HOSPITAL</p>

<p>Morning and evening they hear prayers read, and
soon they too venture to join in the &#8220;Our Father.&#8221;
And every day someone reads and explains in the ward
something about the Lord Jesus Christ, and His love
and His teaching, and they learn that He knows and
loves each little Akbar or Sak&#299;neh and wants them for
His own, and they learn to love Him because He first
loved them. They learn hymns too, and love to sing
them, the same hymns that you know so well, &#8220;Whiter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
than snow,&#8221; &#8220;Simply trusting,&#8221; &#8220;Here we suffer
grief and pain,&#8221; and many others.</p>

<p>The last recalls the story of little B&#257;gum, the child-wife,
who was deliberately and cruelly burnt by her
husband, and was brought to the mission hospital.
There was no hope of recovery, but all was done that
was possible to relieve her pain and brighten her last
days.</p>

<p>She had heard something of the Gospel story from
a missionary who had paid a visit to her native village,
and she had been so interested that she had asked two
Persian children to teach her more. When she was
brought to the hospital even the terrible pain she was
suffering did not make her forget the wonderful story,
and she begged to be told more and more. And resting
in the love of Christ and trusting wholly in Him and
His salvation, she loved to sing of the joy to which He
was going to take her and kept begging for &#8220;Here we
suffer grief and pain,&#8221; and repeating over and over the
refrain, &#8220;Sh&#257;d&#299;, Sh&#257;d&#299;,&#8221; (joy, joy), until even the
Muhammadan women would sit beside her and sing the
hymn that comforted her so much.</p>

<p>In a small village in another part of Persia lived a
little lame girl. She could not walk at all, and her
leg was drawn up so that she could not straighten it,
and she suffered very much. She was a good deal of
trouble to her parents, and they got tired of taking care
of her, and neglected her a good deal, till at last her
father heard of the mission hospital in the neighbouring
town, seventeen miles off, and took her there to see
if the <i>Ferangis</i> (Europeans) could cure her. She was
taken in, washed, and dressed in clean clothes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
put to bed. At first she used to scream when her leg
was touched, but it was operated on, and gradually, very
gradually, the pain grew less, and the leg grew straighter.
But still, as the months went on, the recovery was very
slow, and when the weather grew so hot that the
hospital had to be closed and her father took her
home, though free from pain while she lay still in
bed, the pain was so great when she tried to stand that
she could not walk a step. But as she lay alone on her
bed at home she thought over all she had heard at the
hospital, and one day a new thought struck her.
Surely the <i>Kh&#257;nums</i> had told her that the Lord Jesus
Christ, Who used to cure people so wonderfully, was
alive still and could hear when anyone spoke to Him.
Why had she never asked Him to make her leg well?
And then and there, in her ignorance and simple faith,
she asked Him, Who in the old Gospel days had made
the lame to walk, to make her walk, and, confident in
His love and power, she &#8220;arose and walked.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the hospital was reopened she came back
again still lame, still in pain, but able to walk about
with a stick. And she loved more than ever to hear of
Him who had not only done so much for the sick
Jews of old times, but had done so much too for
her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">A Persian</span> was one day talking to an English missionary
and asked why our King did not annex Persia.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&#8220;It is not right,&#8221; said the missionary, &#8220;to take
what belongs to someone else, and Persia belongs to
your Shah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still your King is surely bound to do as the Bible
tells him, and the Bible tells him to annex it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does the Bible say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it not say that if you see your neighbour&#8217;s
ox or ass fallen into a pit you are to pull it out? And
Persia is an ass fallen into a pit, and your King should
pull her out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, Persia has indeed fallen into a pit, and we must
pull her out, but the pit is not simply one of political
difficulty, it is the pit of Muhammadanism, Persia&#8217;s
most real difficulty, and we must annex Persia for the
King of Kings. As long as the Persians are Muhammadans
lying and dishonesty will be the rule, cruelty
and injustice will go hand in hand, the poor will be
oppressed, the girls and women will be treated as
inferior creatures, the children will be liable to overwork
and cruelty, and religious persecution will continue.
And the Persians are finding out that they
are in the pit and they are struggling to get out, they
are crying to us for help. Are we going to help them?</p>

<p>Thousands of Muhammadans in Persia are dissatisfied
with their religion, and are looking for something
better. Many are trying a dissenting form of
Muhammadanism, called B&#257;b&#299;ism, but many are looking
to Christianity for help.</p>

<p>At first they distrusted the Christians, and Christian
work was constantly hindered or stopped. Now they
have learnt to know and trust the Christians, and the
work is not greatly interfered with. Indeed everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the Persians are asking for teachers and doctors,
for schools and hospitals, and for Christian teaching.</p>

<p>If we do not help them in their search after the Way,
the Truth, and the Light, Muhammad&#8217;s mistake, which
has caused so much misery, may be repeated, and
Christianity rejected in favour of some new religion
made to suit the needs of the moment, but not the
needs of eternity. We must all put our shoulder to
the wheel to prevent that.</p>

<p>The Persians are well worth an effort. Numbers
of Babis went to their death in 1903 rather than deny
their prophet, and even children have stood persecution
for Christ. &#8220;I have a foolish husband,&#8221; said one
little girl. &#8220;He says he will beat Jesus Christ out of
me, but he can only beat my body, and Jesus Christ is
in my heart, so he cannot beat Him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Persians are naturally a religious people,
and if their religious energy could be turned from dead
works, formal prayers, fastings, pilgrimages, divining,&mdash;turned
to the service of the true and living God, what
a splendid people they might be again, what a force
for God in Asia, and in the world. For the wave of
true religious life would act again on us and help us
on. God grant we may yet see the Persian, stunted
as he is by Muhammadanism, grow up to a perfect
man to the measure of the stature of the fulness of
Christ. And what is <i>our</i> part in this great work? It
is threefold.</p>

<p>1. <i>Prayer.</i> Persia wants our prayers. God wants
our prayers for Persia. We none of us know all the
power and possibilities of prayer, and most of us are
surprised when we get direct and obvious answers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
our prayers. It takes us a long time to find out that
God answers all our prayers, but He does. And there
are many in Persia who need our prayers: the missionaries;
the converts, often standing alone in a Muhammadan
house or even in a village or in a quarter of the
town, with no Christian friend to encourage them; the
inquirers, perplexed as to the truth, or struggling
with their fears of confessing the Saviour in Whom they
have learnt to believe; the untouched Muhammadans,
oppressing or oppressed; the schools, the hospitals
and dispensaries, and the services held week by week
in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>2. <i>Giving.</i> We may help to send out missionaries
and to keep up the schools and hospitals, either by
giving some of our money, or our time and work.
Have you only five loaves and two small fishes? Our
Lord can use them to feed five thousand men besides
women and children.</p>

<p>3. <i>Personal service.</i> We cannot all be missionaries
in the foreign field. No, but those who cannot give
themselves for foreign service can do &#8220;garrison duty&#8221;
at home. People often try to dissuade missionaries
from going abroad, telling them they are wanted at
home. But they ought not to be wanted at home;
every Christian who cannot go abroad ought to be
doing his share of the work at home, so that those
who can go abroad may be spared.</p>

<p>And you who read this book, if you want to help
forward God&#8217;s kingdom in heathen and Muhammadan
lands, set to work now at once to fit yourselves to work
as Christian teachers, that you may be ready to take
your place in the ranks here or there as the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Captain places you. Get to know your Bibles well,
studying them if possible with commentaries or aids.
Do not let shyness stand in the way of your undertaking
direct Christian work if you are old enough.
Do your lessons or your work thoroughly and well, and
so make yourselves more fit to be used when the time
comes. Get into good habits of healthy living and
simple food. Put away all unkind words and thoughts
and learn to live in charity with all men. Be regular
in your prayers morning and evening, and if possible
get a regular time for midday prayer, even if it is
only two minutes, but speak to God too all through
the day&mdash;get into the habit of turning to Him at all
times. For whether we work here at home or far
away in foreign lands we can only do God&#8217;s work by
keeping in close touch with Him.</p>
